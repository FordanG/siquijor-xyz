## Content Strategy Tips

### Time Your Visits

**6-8 AM**: Major attractions (Cambugahay, Salagdoong) before crowds
**9-11 AM**: Secondary spots with good light
**12-2 PM**: Shaded locations (caves, convent interiors, forests)
**3-5 PM**: Beach locations, building toward sunset
**5-7 PM**: Sunset spots (Paliton, lighthouse, viewpoints)

### Variety Wins

Don't post five waterfall photos. Mix categories:
- Action (jumping, swinging)
- Scenic (landscape, sunset)
- Cultural (church, historical)
- Adventure (cave, hiking)
- Relaxation (beach, resort)

### The Aesthetic

Siquijor fits several aesthetics:
- **Tropical paradise**: Blues, greens, beaches
- **Adventure**: Action shots, exploration
- **Mystical**: Ancient trees, fog, forest
- **Cultural**: Colonial architecture, local life

Maintain consistency or deliberately juxtapose for interest.

### Ethical Content Creation

- Don't damage natural areas for shots
- Respect local spaces and customs
- Ask permission before photographing people
- Don't fabricate experiences you didn't have
- Leave locations cleaner than you found them

## The Anti-Instagram Spots

Sometimes the best content isn't where everyone points their phones. Consider:

- **Morning fish market**: Real local life
- **Village basketball courts**: Universal sport, unique setting
- **Sari-sari stores**: Colorful, authentic commerce
- **Roadside attractions**: Quirky, unexpected
- **Random coastal views**: Your own discovery

These won't trend, but they'll feel more real—and more yours.
