# Underwater Photography in Siquijor: Complete Dive Site Guide

Beneath Siquijor's turquoise surface lies a photographer's playground: pristine coral gardens, macro critters hiding in every crevice, and marine life undisturbed by the crowds found at better-known dive destinations. For underwater photographers, this island offers what money can't always buy—healthy reefs, clear water, and room to work.

This guide covers Siquijor's dive sites through a photographer's lens, with specific recommendations for subjects, techniques, and the shots that make each site unique.

## Why Siquijor for Underwater Photography

### The Marine Sanctuary Network

Siquijor has established over 20 marine protected areas around the island. These no-take zones have allowed fish populations and coral to recover, creating photogenic environments rarely found in more accessible destinations.

### Visibility and Conditions

- **Best months**: March-June (15-30m visibility)
- **Good months**: November-February (10-20m)
- **Variable**: July-October (5-15m, depends on storms)

### Diversity in Small Spaces

The island's geology—volcanic origins creating varied underwater topography—means you can shoot walls, slopes, sandy flats, and coral gardens all within a 30-minute boat ride.

### The Pace

Fewer divers means you can take your time. No one's rushing you through a shot. Your dive guide knows you're here for photos and adjusts accordingly.

## Equipment Overview

### Camera Options

**Entry Level**: GoPro or action camera
- Pros: Affordable, durable, wide angle
- Cons: Limited control, small sensor
- Best for: Video, environmental shots

**Compact in Housing**: Sony RX100, Canon G7X, etc.
- Pros: Versatile, manual control, reasonable cost
- Cons: Small sensor, limited lens options
- Best for: All-around use, travel photographers

**Mirrorless/DSLR Systems**: Sony A7, Nikon Z, Canon EOS
- Pros: Best quality, lens flexibility, professional results
- Cons: Expensive, complex, heavy
- Best for: Serious shooters, selling images

### Lens Selection

**Wide Angle** (for Siquijor):
- Fisheye (8-15mm) for dramatic reefscapes
- Rectilinear wide (16-35mm) for balanced scenes
- Use for: Reef scenes, large animals, environmental portraits

**Macro**:
- 60mm for larger subjects (nudibranchs, shrimp)
- 100-105mm for tiny subjects, more working distance
- Use for: Nudibranchs, crustaceans, fish portraits

### Lighting

Underwater, you bring your own light:

**Strobes**: Most control, freeze action, true colors
**Video Lights**: See what you're lighting, continuous output
**Both**: Ideal for versatile shooting

For Siquijor's relatively shallow sites, one strobe can suffice. Two provide better, shadow-free lighting.

<ProTip>
If you're new to underwater photography, start with natural light and a red filter. Master composition and subject approach before adding strobe complexity. The filter restores warm tones lost to water absorption.
</ProTip>

## Site-by-Site Photography Guide

### Tubod Marine Sanctuary

**Photo Tips**:
- Fast shutter speeds for moving subjects
- Position with sun for backlit drama
- Patient drifting often brings subjects to you
- Deep means careful bottom time management

<Warning>
Deep photography sites require careful dive planning. Air consumption increases when concentrating on photography. Monitor depth, time, and air more carefully than on shallow dives.
</Warning>

## Techniques for Siquijor Conditions

### Working with Natural Light

Siquijor's clear water and shallow sites allow beautiful natural light photography:

**Sunburst Shots**:
- Position sun in frame edge
- f/16-f/22 for star effect
- Include reef silhouette as foreground

**Blue Water Backgrounds**:
- Face open water, not reef
- Subject lit by strobe, background by ambient
- Balance exposure carefully

**Color Restoration**:
- Red filter on lens
- White balance to "underwater" preset
- Works best in top 10m

### Strobe Techniques

**Macro Lighting**:
- Strobes close to subject
- Angle to avoid flat front-lighting
- One strobe at 45° often sufficient
- Snoots for creative spots

**Wide-Angle Lighting**:
- Strobes wide to minimize backscatter
- Arms extended, angled slightly inward
- Often needs full power for coverage
- TTL can work; manual offers control

### Approaching Subjects

**Rule One**: Never chase
- Let subjects become accustomed to your presence
- Approach slowly, pause frequently
- Allow them to resume normal behavior

**Buoyancy Matters**:
- Poor buoyancy = disturbed sediment = ruined shots
- Practice hovering before adding camera
- Use reef hooks where appropriate
- Never stand on coral

<ProTip>
The best underwater photographers spend more time watching than shooting. Understanding behavior helps predict shots—like knowing when a frogfish will strike or where a nudibranch is heading.
</ProTip>

## Subject-Specific Tips

### Nudibranchs

Siquijor hosts dozens of nudibranch species. These slow-moving subjects are perfect for macro practice.

**Shooting Tips**:
- Get eye level (or rhinophore level)
- Focus on rhinophores (the "horns")
- Show the full animal when possible
- Backgrounds can make or break shots

### Anemonefish

Everyone wants the classic clownfish portrait. In Siquijor, you'll find several species.

**Shooting Tips**:
- Wait for fish to pause, face forward
- Include anemone for environmental context
- Catch the moment of mouth opening
- f/8-f/11 for some background anemone detail

### Turtles

Green and hawksbill turtles are regularly seen in Siquijor waters.

**Shooting Tips**:
- Don't crowd; let turtle approach or pass
- Face-on shots show personality
- Silhouette against surface for drama
- Feeding shots tell a story

### Corals

Siquijor's healthy coral deserves documentation.

**Shooting Tips**:
- Wide angle for expansive gardens
- Macro for polyp details
- Nighttime reveals extended polyps
- Look for diversity in single frame

## Post-Processing Underwater Images

### Color Correction

Water absorbs red light first, leaving images blue-green. Fix in post:
- Increase red channel or decrease blue
- Adjust white balance to underwater subject
- Handle each image individually—depth varies color

### Backscatter Removal

Even perfect technique may leave some particles:
- Clone stamp for isolated spots
- Content-aware fill for larger areas
- Prevention is easier than correction

### Sharpening and Detail

Underwater images often benefit from:
- Clarity increase for texture
- Subtle sharpening on subject
- Dehaze if visibility was reduced
- Detail enhancement in raw processing

## Practical Considerations

### Dive Shop Selection

Choose a shop that accommodates photographers:
- Small groups or private guides
- Flexibility with dive times
- Knowledge of photo subjects
- Patience with longer dives

### Pre-Dive Prep

Before every dive:
- Check o-rings, lubricate as needed
- Test camera function
- Confirm strobe/light batteries
- Clear memory cards
- Clean ports

### Post-Dive Care

After every dive:
- Rinse in fresh water (camera in housing)
- Don't open housing until dry
- Store in cool, dry place
- Charge batteries overnight

## Building Your Siquijor Portfolio

### Day 1-2: Orientation
Dive without camera. Learn sites, practice buoyancy, identify subjects for later.

### Day 3-4: Macro Focus
Concentrate on small subjects at Tubod and calm sites.

### Day 5-6: Wide Angle
Tackle walls and coral gardens for reefscape images.

### Day 7: Specialized
Return to best sites for specific subjects or conditions.

### Backup Days
Weather and visibility change. Build in flexibility.

## Beyond the Photography

Siquijor's marine sanctuaries represent conservation success stories. While photographing, consider your impact:

- Never touch, move, or manipulate subjects
- Avoid damaging coral with fins or equipment
- Don't chase animals for shots
- Share images that inspire conservation
- Support sanctuaries with donations if moved to do so

The reef you photograph today should be healthier tomorrow because of how you treated it.
