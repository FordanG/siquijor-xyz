In the heart of Lazi municipality stands one of the Philippines' most remarkable examples of colonial-era religious architecture: **San Isidro Labrador Parish Church**, more commonly known simply as Lazi Church. Together with its adjacent convent—once the largest in Asia—this historic complex offers visitors a window into Siquijor's rich cultural and spiritual heritage.

## Historical Significance

### The Church
Construction of Lazi Church was completed in **1884** by the Augustinian Recollects, built primarily of coral stone (sea stones) and hardwood. The church features neoclassical architecture with its floors still in their original form, a testament to the craftsmanship of Filipino builders over a century ago.

The bell tower attached to one side of the church was built one year later and remains the most dominant external feature. Its sturdy construction has withstood typhoons and earthquakes, standing as a beacon for the Lazi community for nearly 140 years.

### The Convent
Right across from the church stands the **Lazi Convent**, built in **1887**. At the time of its construction, it was the largest convent in Asia—a remarkable achievement for a small island province. Today, the convent functions as the **Siquijor Heritage Museum**, housing artifacts, religious items, and historical documents.

### Recognition and Awards
- **1984:** Declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines
- **2012:** Named a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines
- Listed as a Baroque Church of the Philippines and submitted by NCCA to UNESCO as a candidate for World Heritage Site status

<ProTip type="insider">
The design elements of the original Baroque style are visible throughout the structure, even though some partitions have been removed over time. Architecture enthusiasts will appreciate the attention to detail in the stonework and woodwork.

- Remove hats inside the church

### Best Times to Visit

<ProTip>
It's a bit of a random stop on most Siquijor itineraries, so if you'd like more context, consider joining an organized tour that combines this with other cultural points of interest. Having a local guide explain the stories, legends, and everyday life behind the architecture makes the experience much more meaningful.
</ProTip>

## Getting There

Lazi Church is located in the center of Lazi municipality, on the south coast of Siquijor.

**Travel Times:**
- From San Juan: approximately 20 minutes
- From Cambugahay Falls: 5-10 minutes
- From Larena Port: 35 minutes
- From Siquijor Port: 30 minutes

The church is right on the main road through Lazi town, making it impossible to miss.

## Understanding the Spanish Influence

Visiting Lazi Church provides insight into the profound Spanish influence on Siquijor and the Philippines. The clear Catholic heritage—the massive church, the largest convent in Asia, the religious artifacts—speaks to centuries of Spanish colonial rule that shaped Filipino culture.

Walking through the stone corridors, you can almost hear the echoes of history: Spanish friars, Filipino parishioners, and the blend of cultures that created something uniquely Filipino.

What's particularly striking about Siquijor is how this Spanish Catholic heritage coexists with the island's pre-colonial beliefs in folk healing and spiritual practices. Lazi Church represents the official religion, while just kilometers away, traditional healers maintain practices that predate Spanish arrival.

## Combining with Other Lazi Attractions

Lazi municipality is home to several of Siquijor's top attractions, making it easy to combine the church visit with other activities:

**Suggested Lazi Itinerary:**
1. **8:00 AM** — Cambugahay Falls (before crowds)
2. **10:30 AM** — Lazi Church and Convent
3. **11:30 AM** — Old Enchanted Balete Tree (5-10 minutes away)
4. **12:30 PM** — Lunch in Lazi town
5. **2:00 PM** — Lagaan Falls or Locong Falls
6. **4:00 PM** — Return to San Juan for sunset

You can also visit the church before or after Cambugahay Falls, as they're very close to each other.

## The Living Heritage

Beyond its historical significance, Lazi Church remains a vibrant center of community life. On Sundays and religious holidays, the church fills with local families attending mass. During fiestas and special celebrations, the plaza comes alive with festivities.

The parish is dedicated to **Saint Isidore the Laborer**, patron saint of farmers—fitting for an island with strong agricultural traditions. The church's connection to its community continues the legacy of nearly 150 years.

## Local Tips

1. **Combine with Cambugahay Falls** — The church is very close to the famous waterfall
2. **Visit the convent museum** — The PHP 20 fee is worth it for history buffs
3. **Talk to the locals** — Church caretakers often share interesting stories
4. **Attend a mass** — For a truly immersive cultural experience
5. **Bring cash** — For museum entrance and any donations

## Final Thoughts

Lazi Church and Convent may not be the most famous attraction in Siquijor—most visitors come for waterfalls and beaches—but for those interested in history, culture, and architecture, it's genuinely impressive.

Standing inside these century-old walls, seeing the original stone floors, and imagining the generations of Siquijodnons who have worshipped here provides a depth of experience that outdoor attractions can't match. It's a reminder that Siquijor's magic isn't just in its natural beauty, but in its rich human history.

Whether you're religious or not, a few minutes walking through this National Historical Landmark offers perspective on the layers of culture that make Siquijor unique. And with no entrance fee for the church itself, it's an easy addition to any Lazi itinerary.

Just remember to dress respectfully, keep your voice low, and take a moment to appreciate the craftsmanship and history that went into creating this remarkable place.
