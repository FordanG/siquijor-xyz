# Siquijor Food Guide: Flavors of the Mystic Island

Siquijor won't win culinary awards. It's not a food destination like Manila's restaurant scene or Cebu's lechon capital. But that's missing the point. The island's food is honest—fresh seafood pulled from morning catches, vegetables from backyard gardens, cooking methods passed through generations.

This guide helps you find the island's best eating, from beach shacks to local markets.

## The Local Flavors

### Seafood Stars

**Fresh Fish (Isda)**
The day's catch varies: tangigue (Spanish mackerel), lapu-lapu (grouper), bangus (milkfish), tuna, and dozens of others. Preparation options:
- Inihaw (grilled with salt and calamansi)
- Paksiw (sour broth with vinegar)
- Sinigang (tamarind-sour soup)
- Kinilaw (raw, citrus-cured—Filipino ceviche)

**Kinilaw**
The island's signature dish. Raw fish "cooked" in vinegar and citrus, with onion, ginger, and chili. Each cook has their version. Find it at beach restaurants and local eateries.

**Grilled Squid (Inihaw na Pusit)**
Stuffed with tomato and onion, grilled over coconut husks. Simple and perfect.

**Shrimp and Crab**
Available but pricier than fish. Usually steamed with garlic butter or grilled.

### Island Specialties

**Buko (Coconut)**
Coconut appears everywhere:
- Fresh buko juice (from young coconuts)
- Coconut milk in curries and desserts
- Coconut oil in cooking
- Buko pie (coconut pie, check local bakeries)

**Pork Dishes**
- Humba (sweet braised pork, Visayan specialty)
- Lechon kawali (crispy deep-fried pork belly)
- Adobo (the national dish—pork or chicken in vinegar-soy)

**Vegetables**
- Ensaladang talong (grilled eggplant salad)
- Pinakbet (mixed vegetables with shrimp paste)
- Kangkong (water spinach, sautéed with garlic)

### Street Food

Found at markets and roadside stalls:
- Balut (fertilized duck egg—the adventurous choice)
- Isaw (grilled chicken intestine)
- BBQ skewers (pork or chicken)
- Kwek-kwek (deep-fried quail eggs in orange batter)
- Banana cue (caramelized bananas on stick)

<ProTip>
For street food, choose stalls with high turnover—the queue indicates both popularity and freshness. Avoid items sitting too long.
</ProTip>

- **Salagdoong Beach**: Basic resort food
- **Solangon Beach**: Multiple choices along the strip

Quality varies. Seafood is generally reliable; international attempts less so.

## The Karinderya Experience

### What Is It?

Karinderya (also turo-turo, meaning "point-point") are local eateries where:
- Pre-cooked dishes displayed behind glass
- You point at what you want
- Rice is the base, dishes are toppings
- Prices are minimal (₱50-100 total)

### How to Navigate

1. Approach the display
2. Survey options (meat dishes, vegetables, fish)
3. Point at 2-3 items
4. Say "rice" or point at the rice pot
5. Sit and eat
6. Pay on exit

### What to Order

**Safe choices**:
- Adobo (chicken or pork)
- Ginisang vegetables (sautéed veggies)
- Fried fish

**Adventurous choices**:
- Dinuguan (pork blood stew)
- Kare-kare (oxtail in peanut sauce)
- Whatever looks interesting

<ProTip>
Arrive at lunchtime (11:30-12:30) for freshest options. By late afternoon, food has sat longer.
</ProTip>

## Seafood Market Dining

### The System

Several seafood restaurants operate on a "wet market" system:
1. View fresh seafood on ice
2. Choose what you want (fish, squid, shrimp)
3. Specify cooking method
4. Pay by weight
5. They cook, you eat

### Cooking Options

**Inihaw**: Grilled with salt and calamansi
**Sinugba**: Grilled with specific marinades
**Paksiw**: Sour vinegar broth
**Sinigang**: Tamarind soup
**Kinilaw**: Raw, cured in citrus
**Garlic butter**: Pan-fried with garlic butter

Squid: ₱250-400/kg
Shrimp: ₱400-600/kg
Crab: ₱500-800/kg

Cooking fee: ₱50-100 per dish

A satisfying seafood meal for two: ₱400-700 total

## Breakfast Options

### Filipino Breakfast

The traditional silog format:
- Sinangag (garlic fried rice)
- Itlog (fried egg)
- Protein: Tapa (beef), Longganisa (sausage), Tocino (sweet cured pork), Bangus (milkfish)

Named by protein: Tapsilog, Longsilog, Tocilog, Bangsilog

Found at: Most local eateries, some resorts

### Western Breakfast

Available at tourist-oriented restaurants:
- Pancakes
- Toast and eggs
- Muesli/granola
- Fruit plates

More expensive than local breakfast (₱150-300 vs ₱80-120)

## Coffee and Drinks

### Coffee

**Local style**: Instant coffee (3-in-1 packets)
**Tourist areas**: Proper brewed coffee available
**Specialty coffee**: Limited—don't expect craft quality

### Fresh Drinks

- Buko juice (coconut water—insist on fresh, not canned)
- Calamansi juice (small citrus, sweet-sour)
- Fresh fruit shakes (mango, banana, watermelon)
- Fresh coconut (whole buko with straw)

### Beer and Alcohol

- San Miguel (the national beer—Pale Pilsen or Light)
- Red Horse (stronger lager)
- Tanduay (local rum)
- Imported beer (limited, resort restaurants)

## Practical Tips

### Cash is King

Most eateries don't accept cards. ATMs exist in Siquijor Town and Larena but can run out of money. Bring enough cash for the trip.

### Portion Sizes

Filipino restaurants often serve family-style. Two dishes with rice can feed two people. Ordering individually at local joints is normal.

### Timing

- Breakfast: 6-9 AM (markets busiest 6-8 AM)
- Lunch: 11:30 AM-1 PM (best karinderya selection)
- Dinner: 6-9 PM (seafood restaurants busy 7-8 PM)

### Food Safety

Standard tropical precautions:
- Eat at busy places with turnover
- Avoid ice if uncertain about source
- Cooked food safer than raw
- Wash hands or use sanitizer
- Trust your instincts

Most visitors have no problems. Stomach issues are usually from overindulgence, not food quality.

### Dietary Restrictions

**Vegetarian**: Possible but limited. Ask for "walang karne" (no meat). Vegetables and rice are standard. Cross-contamination possible.

**Vegan**: Challenging. Limited options outside resort restaurants. Consider self-catering.

**Allergies**: Be specific. "Walang" + ingredient. Shellfish and peanuts are common. Communication can be difficult—be careful.

**Halal**: Not available. The island is predominantly Catholic.

<Warning>
If you have severe allergies, consider staying at accommodations with kitchens. Local restaurants may not fully understand cross-contamination risks.
</Warning>

## A Day of Eating

**6:00 AM**: Fresh buko from roadside vendor

**7:30 AM**: Tapsilog breakfast at Mang Nino's—garlic rice, fried egg, sizzling beef. ₱85

**12:00 PM**: Karinderya lunch—adobo, pinakbet, rice. ₱60

**3:00 PM**: Banana cue from street vendor. ₱15

**6:30 PM**: Seafood dinner—grilled tanigue, garlic butter squid, kangkong, rice for two. ₱450

**8:30 PM**: San Miguel beers at beach bar. ₱60 each

**Daily food total**: Approximately ₱750 for one person eating well

## The Honest Truth

Siquijor isn't a culinary destination. You won't find innovative fusion or Instagram-worthy plating. The best restaurants are functional, not fancy.

But the seafood is fresh—sometimes hours from ocean to plate. The local dishes are authentic, unchanged by tourism. And the prices let you eat well without calculation.

Come hungry. Eat simply. Leave satisfied.
