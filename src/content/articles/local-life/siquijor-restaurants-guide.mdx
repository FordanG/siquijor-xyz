| Lechon Kawali | Crispy pork belly | PHP 60-80 |
| Kinilaw | Raw fish ceviche | PHP 60-100 |
| Grilled Fish | Fresh catch, simply grilled | PHP 80-150 |

### Where to Find Them

- **Siquijor town market:** Multiple options
- **San Juan market:** Local eateries near the church
- **Along main road:** Look for "Kainan" or "Carinderia" signs

<Warning severity="info">

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor won't win culinary awards against Manila or Cebu, but it offers satisfying variety for an island its size. The key is adjusting expectations—you're not here for Michelin stars. You're here for fresh seafood by the beach, cold drinks at sunset, and the simple pleasure of good food in a beautiful setting.

Mix it up: do sunset cocktails at Baha Bar one evening, simple grilled fish at a local carinderia the next. Splurge at Salamandas for a special occasion, grab market breakfast to save pesos. The best meals often happen unexpectedly—a restaurant you stumble upon, a dish recommended by a local, a sunset that makes everything taste better.

Bring cash, come hungry, and enjoy.
