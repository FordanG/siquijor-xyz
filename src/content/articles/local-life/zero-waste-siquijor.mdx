Siquijor has positioned itself as an environmental leader in the Philippines, declaring itself a **zero-waste province**. This isn't just marketing—it's a serious commitment that affects how you'll travel here. Understanding and respecting these policies helps preserve the pristine environment that makes Siquijor special.

## What "Zero Waste" Means

Siquijor's zero-waste initiative aims to eliminate single-use plastics and ensure proper waste management across the island.

### Prohibited Items

The following single-use plastics are banned:

- **Plastic bags** (shopping bags, packaging)
- **Plastic straws**
- **Styrofoam containers**
- **Disposable plastic utensils** (spoons, forks, cups)
- **Single-use sachets** (shampoo, coffee, etc.)

### What's Encouraged

- Reusable water bottles
- Cloth or woven shopping bags (bayong)
- Metal or bamboo straws
- Biodegradable packaging
- Refillable containers

<Warning severity="warning">
This is actively enforced. Ferry terminals and some businesses may ask you to dispose of single-use plastics. Come prepared with reusable alternatives.
</Warning>

## Why Siquijor Went Zero Waste

### Environmental Pressure

Like many Philippine islands, Siquijor faced growing waste problems:
- Limited landfill space
- Plastic pollution on beaches
- Marine life affected by waste
- Tourism threatening natural beauty

### Proactive Solution

Rather than wait for crisis, Siquijor's provincial government implemented strict policies:
- **Provincial Ordinance** banning single-use plastics
- **Waste segregation** requirements for all households and businesses
- **Community education** programs
- **Tourism guidelines** for visitors

### Results

The initiative has shown visible results:
- Cleaner beaches
- Reduced marine debris

## Practical Guide for Visitors

### Essential Items to Bring

1. **Reusable Water Bottle**
   - Most important item
   - Refill at accommodations, restaurants, and refill stations
   - Collapsible bottles save space

2. **Eco-Bags**
   - Bring 2-3 cloth bags
   - Needed for any shopping
   - Markets won't provide plastic bags

3. **Reef-Safe Sunscreen**
   - Regular sunscreen damages coral reefs
   - Check ingredients: avoid oxybenzone and octinoxate
   - Available in some Siquijor shops, but better to bring

4. **Reusable Straw (Optional)**
   - If you use straws, bring metal or bamboo
   - Many places now offer paper or bamboo alternatives

5. **Reusable Food Container (Optional)**
   - Useful for takeaway food
   - Some places still use styrofoam (though not allowed)

<ProTip type="tip">
Pack your reusables in your carry-on bag, not checked luggage. You'll need them immediately upon arrival for water and any purchases at the port.
</ProTip>

### Water Solutions

Staying hydrated in tropical heat is essential. Here's how to do it sustainably:

**At Your Accommodation:**
- Most hotels and hostels have water refill stations
- Some provide filtered water in your room
- Ask about refill options when booking

**On the Go:**
- Refill before leaving your accommodation
- Many restaurants will refill bottles for free or small fee
- Water refill stations exist in towns (around PHP 5-10 per liter)

**If You Must Buy Bottled:**
- Some stores still sell bottled water
- Choose larger sizes to reduce plastic
- Look for glass bottles when available

### Shopping

**At Markets:**
- Bring your own bags (essential)
- Vendors use paper or banana leaves for some items
- No plastic bags provided

**At Stores:**
- Same rules apply
- Some shops sell woven bags (bayong) if you forgot yours

**Souvenirs:**
- Many local crafts use sustainable materials
- Avoid items with excessive packaging
- Support artisans using traditional, natural materials

## Waste Segregation

Siquijor practices strict waste segregation. You'll see color-coded bins:

| Color | Type | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| Green | Biodegradable | Food waste, leaves, paper |
| Blue | Recyclable | Plastic bottles, metal cans, glass, cardboard |
| Black/Gray | Residual | Non-recyclable, non-biodegradable items |

### At Your Accommodation

- Follow segregation guidelines in your room
- Ask staff if unsure which bin to use
- Some places have additional categories (e-waste, hazardous)

### At Attractions

- Bins available at most tourist spots
- If no bins, carry waste until you find one
- Never litter—it's both disrespectful and harmful

<ProTip type="insider">
When in doubt, ask. Locals appreciate visitors who take waste segregation seriously. It shows respect for their efforts to keep the island clean.
</ProTip>
