If there's one image that captures Siquijor's mystical reputation, it's the **Old Enchanted Balete Tree**. This 400-year-old giant, with its massive trunk and ethereal hanging vines, has become the island's most iconic landmark—a living symbol of the folklore, mystery, and magic that make Siquijor unlike anywhere else in the Philippines.

## The Tree That Launched a Thousand Stories

The century-old Balete Tree isn't just any old tree. In Filipino folklore, balete trees are believed to be homes for supernatural beings—kapre (tall, dark tree-dwelling giants), engkanto (nature spirits), and other mystical creatures. This particular tree, with its gargantuan size and bizarre, otherworldly appearance, has accumulated centuries of stories and beliefs.

Long vines hang like hair from its outstretched branches. The thick canopy creates an almost cave-like atmosphere underneath. And at its base, a natural spring bubbles up from an unknown source—adding to the mystery.

## What Makes It Special

### The Tree Itself
Standing before the Old Enchanted Balete Tree is genuinely impressive. This isn't just any tree—it's a massive, ancient presence that dominates its surroundings. The tangled roots, the hanging vines, and the twisted branches create a scene that feels pulled from a fantasy novel.

### The Mysterious Spring
At the base of the tree is a freshwater pond whose origin remains unknown, according to locals. The water simply appears, flowing from somewhere beneath the roots. Some locals claim to have seen serpents emerging from inside the hole, adding to the mystique.

### The Fish Spa
Small fish fill the spring, and visitors can dip their feet in for a natural fish spa experience. The fish nibble on dead skin from your soles—ticklish at first, but you get used to it. It's free with your entrance fee and genuinely fun.

### The Souvenirs
A souvenir shop near the tree sells:
- Love potions (the "mild" variety)
- Amulets and charms
- T-shirts and caps
- Traditional healing items
- Other mystical accessories

<ProTip type="insider">
According to a vendor we asked, the stronger love potions are only available upon special request from actual faith healers. The ones sold at the tourist stalls are just the mild variety—safe for souvenirs!

## The Honest Truth

We'll be straight with you: opinions on the Old Enchanted Balete Tree are mixed.

**The Pros:**
- Genuinely impressive ancient tree
- Fun fish spa experience
- Quick, easy stop on any Lazi itinerary
- Great photo opportunity
- Interesting souvenir shopping

**The Cons:**
- Can feel a bit touristy
- The whole experience takes only about 15-30 minutes
- Some visitors find it underwhelming after the buildup

One traveler put it perfectly: "I know this spot shows up on pretty much every Siquijor itinerary, but personally, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Cool if you've never done a fish spa before, but the whole thing took about five minutes, and I left thinking, 'that's it?'"

That said, if you're passing by anyway (and you will, since it's on the main road), it's absolutely worth a quick stop. Just don't build it up as the highlight of your trip.

<Warning severity="info">
Set your expectations appropriately. The Balete Tree is a quick, quirky stop—not a half-day attraction. Plan to spend 15-30 minutes here, enjoy the fish spa, snap some photos, and continue on to Cambugahay Falls.
</Warning>
