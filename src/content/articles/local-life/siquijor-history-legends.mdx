Siquijor isn't just an island—it's a place steeped in legend, mystery, and centuries of history that set it apart from anywhere else in the Philippines. From the moment Spanish explorers first glimpsed its glowing shores, Siquijor has captivated imaginations. Here's the story of how this small island earned its mystical reputation.

## The Origins: Island of Fire

### The Spanish Arrival (1565)

On April 27, 1565, Spanish explorers **Esteban Rodriguez** and **Juan Aguirre**, part of the Legazpi expedition, first sighted a mysterious island glowing in the darkness.

What they saw was extraordinary: the entire coastline seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly light. The Spanish, possibly superstitious and certainly unfamiliar with the natural phenomenon before them, named this place **"Isla del Fuego"**—the Island of Fire.

### The Truth Behind the Fire

The "flames" were actually millions of **fireflies** (alitaptap) that congregated in the **molave trees** (tugas) lining the shore. The molave—a hardwood tree prized for its durability—grew abundantly along Siquijor's coasts, and fireflies gathered there in such numbers that their bioluminescence created a visible glow from the sea.

This natural spectacle no longer occurs at the same scale. Logging, development, and environmental changes have reduced both the molave forests and firefly populations. But the name and legend endure.

<ProTip type="insider">
The Dilaab Festival, held every March, celebrates this fiery heritage. "Dilaab" refers to the flames of the fireflies, and festival costumes often incorporate glowing, fire-inspired designs.

## The Name: Multiple Legends

How did "Isla del Fuego" become "Siquijor"? Several legends compete for the honor.

### Legend 1: King Kihod

One tradition says the island was named after **King Kihod**, a legendary ruler who governed the island before Spanish colonization. Over time, "Kihod" evolved into "Siquijor."

### Legend 2: The Molave Trees

Another version traces the name to the molave trees themselves, locally called **"tugas."** According to this legend, early inhabitants called their home after these abundant trees, and the name eventually transformed into Siquijor.

### Legend 3: The Spanish Priest

A third story tells of a Spanish priest arriving on the island. When asked where he had traveled from, he replied **"Sequor"**—Latin for "I follow" (perhaps meaning he followed the waves). Local ears misheard this as "Siquijor."

### The Likely Truth

The true origin is probably mundane—a pre-colonial name evolved through centuries of linguistic change. But the legends persist because they're more interesting than etymology.

## Colonial History

### Spanish Era (1565-1898)

After initial contact in 1565, Spanish missionaries gradually established presence on the island.

**Key Events:**
- **1783:** First formal parish established
- **1857-1877:** Additional parishes founded by Augustinian Recollects
- **1884:** Lazi Church completed (now a National Historical Landmark)
- **1887:** Lazi Convent built (once the largest in Asia)

Siquijor was administered as part of **Bohol** province during the Spanish period. The island's isolation kept it somewhat removed from the upheavals affecting larger Philippine islands.

### American Period (1898-1946)

Under American rule, Siquijor remained a sub-province of Bohol. Infrastructure development was minimal given the island's small size and population.

### Post-Independence

After Philippine independence in 1946, Siquijor continued under Bohol's administration until advocates pushed for separate provincial status.

**March 25, 1971:** President Ferdinand Marcos signed **Republic Act 6396**, creating Siquijor as an independent province—the third smallest in the Philippines.

**1972:** The capital was officially established in Siquijor town.

## The Mystical Reputation

### Origins of the "Witchcraft" Legend

Siquijor's association with the supernatural didn't begin with marketing. It has roots going back centuries.

**Contributing Factors:**

1. **Geographic Isolation** — The island's remoteness bred mystery
2. **The Firefly Phenomenon** — The glowing shores suggested otherworldly forces
3. **Traditional Healing Practices** — Folk medicine seemed like magic to outsiders
4. **Catholic-Indigenous Blend** — Syncretism created unique spiritual practices

### The Mananambal Tradition

At the heart of Siquijor's mystical reputation are the **mananambal**—traditional healers who practice folk medicine.

**What They Do:**
- Prepare herbal remedies
- Perform healing rituals
- Diagnose ailments through divination
- Create protective amulets
- Conduct "bolo-bolo" (using a stone in water to extract illness)

**What They Don't Do:**
- Curse or hex people (despite popular misconceptions)
- Practice "black magic"
- Create "love potions" for harm

The mananambal tradition is about healing, not harm. But outsiders unfamiliar with these practices often conflated them with witchcraft.

<Warning severity="info">
The "witchcraft" reputation frustrates many Siquijodnons (locals), who feel it unfairly stigmatizes their island. The tradition is about healing, and practitioners are respected community members, not feared outcasts.
</Warning>

### The Healing Island

In recent decades, Siquijor has rebranded itself as **"The Healing Island"**—emphasizing the positive aspects of its spiritual heritage:

- **Traditional medicine** as cultural heritage
- **Wellness tourism** incorporating local practices
- **Holy Week Healing Festival** attracting curious visitors
- **Mt. Bandilaan** as a center for healer gatherings

## Famous Legends & Folklore

### The Enchanted Balete Tree

In Barangay Campalanas, Lazi, stands a centuries-old **Balete Tree** (Ficus stipulosa) that has become one of Siquijor's most visited attractions.

**The Legends:**
- Spirits (duwende, engkanto) dwell within and around the tree
- The tree grants wishes to respectful visitors
- Strange occurrences happen to those who disrespect it

**The Reality:**
A fish spa operates at the tree's base, where natural spring water feeds a pool filled with small fish that nibble dead skin—probably not what the spirits intended.

### The Aswang Question

Siquijor is sometimes associated with **aswang**—shapeshifting creatures from Filipino folklore that prey on humans.

**Setting the Record Straight:**
- Aswang legends exist throughout the Philippines, not uniquely in Siquijor
- No evidence suggests Siquijor has more "aswang activity" than anywhere else
- The association likely comes from the general mystical reputation
- Most locals find the aswang reputation annoying and unfair

### The Healing Rituals of Holy Week

The most famous ongoing tradition is the **Healing Festival** during Holy Week.

**What Happens:**
- Mananambal gather at sacred locations (especially Mt. Bandilaan)
- Special healing potions are prepared at midnight on Black Saturday
- The timing corresponds with Catholic church bells falling silent
- This liminal moment is considered especially powerful

The blend of Catholic Holy Week observance with pre-colonial healing traditions exemplifies Siquijor's unique spiritual landscape.

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor's history is a palimpsest—layers of pre-colonial beliefs, Spanish Catholicism, American pragmatism, and modern tourism written over each other but never fully erasing what came before.

The fireflies that once made the island glow are largely gone. The molave forests have thinned. But the spirit of Siquijor—that blend of natural wonder and human mystery—endures.

Whether you come for beaches or legends, waterfalls or healing rituals, you're walking into a story centuries in the making. The Island of Fire, the Healing Island, the third smallest province in the Philippines—Siquijor is all of these and something harder to define.

Perhaps that indefinability is the real magic. In an age of Google Maps and Instagram, Siquijor remains a place where mystery persists. Where ancient trees might be enchanted. Where healers practice traditions older than the churches. Where the line between history and legend blurs pleasantly.

Come with respect, leave with questions, and remember: on Siquijor, things aren't always what they seem—and that's exactly the point.
