# Siquijor Safety Guide: The Honest Reality

Let's address the elephant in the room: Siquijor has a reputation throughout the Philippines as a mysterious island of witches and dark magic. Some Filipinos refuse to visit. Horror movies have been set here.

The reality? Siquijor is one of the safest destinations in the Philippines. The "mystical" reputation relates to traditional healing practices, not actual danger. You're far more likely to be harmed by sunburn than supernatural forces.

This guide covers real safety considerations—practical, honest, and useful.

## Overall Safety Assessment

### Crime

**Violent crime**: Essentially nonexistent against tourists. We found no documented cases of assaults, robberies at gunpoint, or similar crimes against visitors.

**Petty theft**: Uncommon but not impossible. Standard precautions apply—don't leave valuables unattended, lock rooms, keep cash secured.

**Scams**: Less common than in tourist-heavy areas of the Philippines. The island is too small for anonymous bad behavior.

**Night safety**: Roads get dark at night. Walking on unlit roads isn't dangerous from crime but from tripping. Most areas where tourists stay are safe after dark.

### Compared to Other Destinations

Siquijor is safer than:
- Manila (obviously)
- Most major tourist cities
- More developed beach destinations

Comparable safety to:
- Small rural Philippine islands
- Rural areas of Thailand or Indonesia

### Why So Safe?

- Small population (96,000) where everyone knows everyone
- Limited road access (island with ferry only)
- Strong community structures
- Relatively prosperous (by Philippine standards)
- Tourism not yet at levels that attract criminal behavior

## Health and Medical

### Medical Facilities

**Siquijor Provincial Hospital**:
- Location: Siquijor Town
- Capacity: Basic emergency care, minor procedures
- Serious cases: Stabilize and transfer to Dumaguete

**Rural Health Units**:
- Each municipality has basic clinics
- First aid, basic medicine
- Limited hours and resources

**Reality check**: For anything serious, you'll need Dumaguete. That means a 1-2 hour process (travel to port, ferry, travel to hospital).

<Warning>
Travel insurance with medical evacuation coverage is strongly recommended. Airlifting from the island costs thousands of dollars without insurance.
</Warning>

### Pharmacies

Basic pharmacies exist in Siquijor Town and Larena. Stock is limited. Bring:
- Prescription medications (bring extra supply)
- Specific medications you rely on
- First aid basics

### Common Health Issues

**Traveler's Diarrhea**:
- Moderate risk
- Usually from food or water
- Prevention: Eat at busy places, drink bottled water
- Treatment: Oral rehydration, rest, most cases resolve in days

**Sun Exposure**:
- High risk (underestimated by many)
- Tropical sun is intense
- Prevention: Sunscreen, hat, cover up, limit midday exposure
- Treatment: Cool compresses, aloe vera, stay hydrated

**Dengue Fever**:
- Mosquito-borne, present in the Philippines
- Prevention: Repellent, long sleeves at dusk/dawn
- Symptoms: High fever, severe headache, joint pain
- Action: Seek medical attention if suspected

**Dehydration**:
- Very common in tropical heat
- Drink more water than you think necessary
- Signs: Dark urine, headache, fatigue

**Cuts and Scrapes**:
- Clean immediately in tropical environments
- Infections develop quickly in humidity
- Bring antiseptic and bandages

### First Aid Kit Recommendations

- Pain reliever (ibuprofen, paracetamol)
- Oral rehydration salts
- Antihistamines
- Bandages and antiseptic
- Sunscreen (SPF 50+)
- Insect repellent (DEET or equivalent)
- Any prescription medications
- Motion sickness pills

## Transportation Safety

### Motorcycles

Motorcycles are the main way tourists explore Siquijor—and the main source of tourist injuries.

**The Good**:
- Roads are well-paved and maintained
- Traffic is light by Philippine standards
- Routes are straightforward
- Beautiful, enjoyable riding

**The Risks**:
- Inexperienced riders renting bikes
- No helmet enforcement (wear one anyway)
- Sand on corners near beaches
- Dogs and animals on roads
- Rain makes roads slippery

**Safety Rules**:
1. Only rent if you have actual riding experience
2. Always wear a helmet (even though no one enforces it)
3. Check bike before accepting (brakes, lights, tires)
4. Drive slower than you think necessary
5. Avoid riding at night
6. Watch for animals on roads
7. Assume you're invisible to others
8. No drinking and riding

<ProTip>
If you haven't ridden motorcycles before, Siquijor isn't the place to learn. Consider tricycles, arranged tours, or a hired driver instead.
</ProTip>

### Tricycles

Safer than motorcycles for passengers:
- Enclosed seating
- Experienced drivers
- Reasonable for distances under 10km

### Ferries

Generally safe. Concerns:
- Rough seas during monsoon (cancellations occur)
- Overcrowding on busy days
- Life vests may be limited

Recommendations:
- Travel during daylight
- Use reputable ferry lines (OceanJet, Montenegro)
- Know where life vests are stored

## Natural Hazards

### Sun

The tropical sun is the most common cause of visitor discomfort:
- Intensity is much higher than temperate regions
- Reflection off water increases exposure
- Cloud cover still allows UV penetration

Prevention:
- Sunscreen SPF 50+, reapply frequently
- Wear hat and cover up during peak hours (10 AM-3 PM)
- Seek shade
- Stay hydrated

### Sea Conditions

**Currents**: Some areas have currents that can sweep swimmers away
- Ask locally about conditions
- Don't swim alone at unfamiliar beaches
- Don't overestimate your swimming ability

**Jellyfish**: Seasonal (often August-October)
- Ask before swimming
- Vinegar helps for stings (some beaches have stations)
- Seek medical attention for severe reactions

**Sea urchins**: Common on rocky areas
- Wear water shoes
- Watch where you step
- Spines break off in skin—seek treatment for removal

### Weather

**Typhoons**: Rare direct hits due to southern location
- Monitor weather during season (June-November)
- Ferries cancel when storms approach
- Follow local advice

**Rain**: Afternoon showers common during wet season
- Flash flooding possible in low areas
- Road surfaces become slippery
- Adjust motorcycle riding accordingly

### Wildlife

**On Land**:
- No dangerous snakes common in tourist areas
- Dogs can be territorial (avoid strange dogs at night)
- Mosquitoes (dengue risk—use repellent)

**In Water**:
- No shark attacks on record
- Sea snakes occasionally seen (generally docile, avoid contact)
- No box jellyfish typically

## The "Mystical" Reality

### The Reputation

Many Filipinos believe Siquijor is home to:
- Mangkukulam (sorcerers)
- Aswang (supernatural creatures)
- Dark magic practitioners

This reputation keeps some Filipinos away—creating the ironic effect of making the island more peaceful.

### The Truth

Siquijor does have traditional healers (mananambal) who practice:
- Herbal medicine
- Massage (hilot)
- Spiritual healing rituals

These are legitimate cultural practices, not dangerous supernatural forces. The "dark" reputation is largely folklore amplified by urban legends and horror movies.

### Your Experience

You won't be cursed. No one will cast spells on you. The island is not spooky or threatening.

What you may experience:
- Traditional healer visits (if you seek them)
- Stories about magic (locals love to share)
- Possibly the most peaceful island in the Philippines

<ProTip>
If locals tell you supernatural stories, enjoy them as culture. They're sharing their heritage, not warning you of real danger.
</ProTip>

## Emergency Information

### Emergency Numbers

- Police: 09xx-xxx-xxxx (varies by municipality—get local number)
- Fire: 09xx-xxx-xxxx
- Hospital: (035) 480-xxxx (Siquijor Provincial)

**Reality**: Emergency response is limited. In serious emergencies:
1. Get to Siquijor Town or Larena
2. Contact your accommodation for help
3. Prepare for possible Dumaguete transfer

### Embassies and Consulates

None in Siquijor. Nearest consulates in Cebu City.

### Insurance Claims

Document everything:
- Photos of injuries/damage
- Police report if applicable
- Medical receipts
- Contact information of witnesses

## Specific Situations

### Solo Female Safety

Siquijor is excellent for solo female travelers:
- Very low harassment
- Respectful local culture
- Other solo women travelers present
- Safe to explore independently

Standard precautions:
- Trust your instincts
- Don't walk alone on dark, empty roads at night
- Be cautious with alcohol around strangers
- Inform someone of your plans

### LGBTQ+ Safety

The Philippines is generally LGBTQ+ tolerant, especially compared to other Southeast Asian countries:
- No anti-LGBTQ+ laws
- Generally accepting attitudes
- Pride is not visible, but hostility is rare

In Siquijor specifically:
- Small-town conservative attitudes may exist
- Discretion may feel more comfortable
- Resort areas are typically welcoming

### Family Safety

Good destination for families:
- Safe environment
- Easy to navigate
- Beach-focused activities
- Relaxed pace

Considerations:
- Limited medical facilities for children
- Some rough paths (not stroller-friendly everywhere)
- Car seats not typically available (bring your own)

## Practical Safety Tips

### Money

- Carry cash (ATMs can run out)
- Don't flash large amounts
- Use hotel safes when available
- Have backup funds somewhere secure

### Documents

- Copies of passport separate from original
- Digital copies in cloud storage
- Travel insurance documents accessible
- Emergency contacts written down

### Communication

- Local SIM card (Globe or Smart)
- Inform someone of travel plans
- Check in regularly with home
- Know location of police stations

### Accommodation

- Lock rooms even briefly
- Don't leave valuables visible
- Know fire exits
- Keep a flashlight accessible (power outages occur)

## The Bottom Line

Siquijor is safe. The real risks are:
1. Motorcycle accidents (preventable with caution)
2. Sun exposure (preventable with protection)
3. Minor health issues (manageable with preparation)

The imagined risks—witchcraft, crime, dangerous wildlife—are negligible or non-existent.

Come with common sense, respect the environment, and you'll find one of the most welcoming, safest islands in Southeast Asia.
