## Dilaab Festival (March)

The **Dilaab Festival** is Siquijor's grandest celebration, held annually during the third week of March. "Dilaab" refers to the flames from fireflies that once lit the island's molave trees, giving Siquijor its Spanish name "Isla del Fuego" (Island of Fire).

### When

March 17-25, with the main events on March 24-25 coinciding with the province's founding anniversary (Republic Act 6396 was signed on March 25, 1971).

### What Happens

**Street Dancing Competition**
The highlight of Dilaab is the street dancing competition featuring contingents from all six municipalities. Performers wear elaborate costumes inspired by fireflies, traditional healing practices, and island mythology.

**Cultural Presentations**
- Traditional dance performances
- Musical showcases
- Drama presentations depicting Siquijor's history
- Indigenous music and instruments

**Trade Fair**
Local products on display and for sale:
- Healing herbs and traditional remedies
- Local crafts and souvenirs
- Island produce and food products

**Beauty Pageant**
Miss Siquijor and related competitions celebrate local beauty and talent.

**Sports Events**
Inter-municipal competitions in basketball, volleyball, and other sports.

### Where

Main events take place in Siquijor town (the capital), with activities spreading to other municipalities.

<ProTip type="tip">
Book accommodations early if visiting during Dilaab Festival. The island fills up with locals returning home and domestic tourists. Rooms in Siquijor town are especially hard to find.
</ProTip>

## Healing Festival (Holy Week)

The most unique of Siquijor's celebrations, the **Healing Festival** draws on the island's reputation as a center for traditional medicine and folk healing.

### When

Holy Week, particularly **Black Saturday** (Sabado de Gloria), when the main rituals occur.

### What Happens

**Mananambal Gathering**
Traditional healers (mananambal) from across the island gather at designated locations, particularly around Mt. Bandilaan, to perform ceremonies and prepare "bolo-bolo" (healing potions).

**Potion Preparation**
At midnight on Black Saturday, when the church bells are silent, healers prepare their most potent medicines. This timing is considered especially powerful.

**Healing Rituals**
Visitors can observe (and sometimes participate in) various healing practices:
- Herbal treatments
- Massage and manipulation
- Bolo-bolo ceremony (using a stone in water to "extract" illness)
- Prayers and incantations

**Religious Observances**
Holy Week is also observed with Catholic traditions:
- Visita Iglesia (church visitations)
- Processions
- Passion plays
- Good Friday services

### Where

- **San Antonio, Mt. Bandilaan** — Traditional gathering point
- Various barangays with known healers
- Churches throughout the island for Catholic observances

<Warning severity="info">
The Healing Festival is a spiritual and cultural event, not a tourist show. Approach with respect. Some healers welcome visitors; others prefer privacy. Always ask permission before photographing.
</Warning>

## Attending Festivals: Practical Tips

### Booking Accommodations

- **Dilaab and Holy Week:** Book 2-4 weeks in advance
- **Municipal festivals:** 1 week advance is usually sufficient
- **Fiestas:** Room availability is usually fine

### Transportation

- Roads can be congested during major festivals
- Tricycles charge higher fares during peak events
- Having your own motorcycle gives flexibility

### What to Bring

- **Camera** — Lots of photo opportunities
- **Cash** — Vendors may not take cards
- **Water** — Stay hydrated at outdoor events
- **Sun protection** — Most festivities happen outdoors
- **Respectful attire** — Especially for religious events

### Etiquette

- **Ask before photographing** people, especially in traditional settings
- **Respect religious ceremonies** — Don't interrupt services
- **Join in appropriately** — Many locals welcome visitor participation
- **Don't treat healing practices as entertainment**

<Warning severity="caution">
During Holy Week, book ferries in advance—both coming and going. The island fills up, and everyone tries to leave on Easter Sunday.
</Warning>
