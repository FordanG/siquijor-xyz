Starting February 1, 2026, the provincial government of Siquijor began collecting a Tourism Ecological Fee from all visitors to the island. This new policy marks a significant step in the province's commitment to sustainable tourism and environmental conservation. Whether you are planning your first visit or returning to the Mystic Island, here is everything you need to know about this fee, how it works, and what it means for your trip.

## What Is the Siquijor Tourism Ecological Fee?

The Tourism Ecological Fee is a mandatory charge collected from tourists and visitors departing Siquijor Island. It was established through a provincial ordinance aimed at generating funds for environmental protection, infrastructure maintenance, and sustainable tourism development across the island's six municipalities.

Unlike entrance fees charged at individual attractions such as Cambugahay Falls or Salagdoong Beach, this is a province-wide fee that applies to all non-resident visitors. The revenue is earmarked specifically for ecological preservation, waste management, marine sanctuary upkeep, and tourism infrastructure improvements.

## How Much Does It Cost?

The Tourism Ecological Fee is structured as follows:

**Domestic tourists (Filipino citizens):** PHP 50 per person

**Foreign tourists:** PHP 100 per person

Children below a certain age and residents of Siquijor province are generally exempt from the fee. The exact age cutoff and exemption details may be confirmed at the collection points upon arrival or departure.

For context, this fee is comparable to similar ecological fees charged in other popular Philippine destinations. Boracay collects a PHP 75 environmental fee, while El Nido in Palawan charges PHP 200 for its Eco-Tourism Development Fee. Siquijor's fee falls on the lower end of this spectrum, making it a modest addition to your travel budget.

## Where and When Is It Collected?

The fee is collected at Siquijor's ports of entry. The primary collection points are:

- **Siquijor Port** (Siquijor town) - the main port serving ferries from Dumaguete and other Visayas destinations
- **Larena Port** - serving routes from Tagbilaran (Bohol) and other connections

Collection happens upon departure from the island. This means you will pay the fee when you leave Siquijor, not when you arrive. Look for the designated Tourism Ecological Fee collection booth or counter near the port terminal. Payment is typically in cash (Philippine Pesos), so make sure to have the exact amount or small bills ready.

## Who Is Exempt?

The following groups are generally exempt from paying the Tourism Ecological Fee:

- **Residents of Siquijor** with valid provincial identification
- **Government officials** on official business with proper documentation
- **Young children** below the specified age threshold (confirm at port)
- **Returning residents** or those with property in the province

If you believe you qualify for an exemption, bring supporting documentation to the collection point. A valid government-issued ID showing a Siquijor address is typically sufficient for residents.

## What Does the Fee Fund?

The Tourism Ecological Fee revenue is allocated toward several critical areas that directly benefit both the island's environment and visitor experience:

### Marine Sanctuary Protection

Siquijor is home to several marine sanctuaries, including the popular Tubod Marine Sanctuary and sanctuaries in Apo Island's surrounding waters. These protected areas require regular monitoring, enforcement against illegal fishing, coral reef rehabilitation, and maintenance of snorkeling and diving infrastructure. The ecological fee helps fund marine rangers, buoy systems, and underwater cleanup operations.

### Waste Management and Cleanup

As tourism grows on the island, waste management becomes increasingly important. The fee supports garbage collection services in tourist areas, beach cleanup programs, and improvements to waste processing facilities. Siquijor has been a leader in the Visayas for its zero-waste initiatives, and this funding helps sustain those efforts.

### Trail and Infrastructure Maintenance

Popular trails leading to waterfalls, viewpoints, and natural attractions require ongoing maintenance for safety and accessibility. Wooden walkways at Cambugahay Falls, steps at Lugnason Falls, and paths through Cantabon Cave all benefit from regular upkeep funded through tourism revenue.

### Environmental Education

A portion of the fee supports environmental awareness programs in local schools and communities. These programs teach sustainable practices to the next generation of Siquijodnons and help maintain the island's reputation as an eco-conscious destination.

### Tourism Development

Funds also support the development of new tourism infrastructure, including information centers, directional signage, rest areas, and viewpoint improvements. This helps distribute tourist traffic more evenly across the island and reduces pressure on the most popular spots.

## How This Compares to Other Philippine Destinations

Understanding Siquijor's fee in context helps put it in perspective:

| Destination | Fee Name | Domestic | Foreign |
|---|---|---|---|
| Siquijor | Tourism Ecological Fee | PHP 50 | PHP 100 |
| Boracay | Environmental Fee | PHP 75 | PHP 75 |
| El Nido, Palawan | Eco-Tourism Dev Fee | PHP 200 | PHP 200 |
| Coron, Palawan | Eco-Tourism Dev Fee | PHP 200 | PHP 200 |
| Siargao | Tourism Fee | PHP 50 | PHP 100 |

Siquijor's fee is among the most affordable in the Philippines, reflecting the provincial government's desire to balance sustainability with accessibility. The island remains one of the most budget-friendly destinations in the Visayas.

## Impact on Your Travel Budget

For most travelers, the Tourism Ecological Fee represents a negligible addition to the overall cost of visiting Siquijor. To put it in perspective:

- A round trip ferry from Dumaguete to Siquijor costs around PHP 200-400
- A typical day of island touring runs PHP 500-1,500 depending on activities
- Accommodation ranges from PHP 500 for budget rooms to PHP 5,000+ for resorts

The PHP 50-100 ecological fee amounts to roughly the cost of a single meal at a local eatery. Most travelers find it a worthwhile contribution to preserving the natural beauty that drew them to the island in the first place.

## Tips for a Smooth Experience

Here are practical tips for dealing with the Tourism Ecological Fee:

**Carry exact change.** Having PHP 50 or PHP 100 ready speeds up the process at the collection point and avoids delays when you are trying to catch a ferry.

**Keep your receipt.** You will receive an official receipt after paying the fee. Hold onto it until you have departed, as it may be checked at the boarding area.

**Budget for it in advance.** While the fee is small, factor it into your overall Siquijor budget, especially if you are traveling with a group. A family of four would pay PHP 200 (domestic) or PHP 400 (foreign).

**Do not confuse with attraction fees.** The Tourism Ecological Fee is separate from entrance fees charged at specific attractions. You will still need to pay individual fees at places like Cambugahay Falls (PHP 30-50), Salagdoong Beach (PHP 40), and Cantabon Cave (guide fee around PHP 300-500).

**Allow extra time at the port.** During peak travel seasons, especially Holy Week and Christmas holidays, lines at the collection point may be longer. Arrive at the port with a comfortable buffer before your ferry departure.

## The Bigger Picture: Sustainable Tourism in Siquijor

Siquijor's introduction of the Tourism Ecological Fee reflects a growing awareness across the Philippines that tourism must be managed sustainably. The island has seen visitor numbers increase steadily over the past decade, and local leaders recognize that without proactive measures, the very natural beauty that attracts tourists could be degraded.

The fee is part of a broader strategy that includes stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, support for community-based tourism initiatives, and investment in renewable energy. Siquijor's relatively small size (only 343 square kilometers) makes it particularly vulnerable to the environmental impacts of unmanaged tourism growth.

For visitors, paying the ecological fee is a simple way to contribute to the island's preservation. It is a small price to ensure that Siquijor's pristine beaches, thriving coral reefs, lush waterfalls, and enchanting forests remain intact for future generations of travelers.
