Before you set foot on Siquijor, there are a few things you should know about entry requirements and local regulations. The island has positioned itself as an eco-conscious destination, and following the guidelines ensures a smooth visit while helping preserve this special place.

## Standard Travel Requirements

### For Filipino Citizens

- Valid government-issued ID
- No special permits or documentation needed
- Standard ferry ticket

### For Foreign Tourists

- Valid passport (6 months validity recommended)
- Appropriate visa (if required by your nationality)
- Standard ferry ticket

Most nationalities don't need a visa for stays up to 30 days in the Philippines. Check with the Bureau of Immigration for your specific country's requirements.

## Siquijor's Zero-Waste Policy

This is the most important thing to know: **Siquijor is a zero-waste province.** Single-use plastics are strictly prohibited.

### What This Means for You

**Prohibited Items:**
- Single-use plastic bags
- Plastic straws
- Styrofoam containers
- Disposable plastic utensils
- Single-use sachets (technically, though enforcement varies)

**What to Bring Instead:**
- Reusable water bottle (essential)
- Cloth shopping bag or eco-bag
- Metal or bamboo straws (if you use straws)
- Reusable food containers (for takeaway)

<Warning severity="warning">
This isn't just a suggestion—it's enforced. Ferries and businesses may confiscate single-use plastics. Many stores won't provide plastic bags. Come prepared.
</Warning>

### Water on the Island

- Bring a reusable bottle and refill at your accommodation
- Many hotels and hostels have water refilling stations
- Some establishments sell water in recyclable glass bottles
- Avoid buying plastic bottles if possible

<ProTip type="tip">
Pack a collapsible water bottle in your luggage. Fill it before leaving your accommodation each day. Staying hydrated in tropical heat is crucial, and having your own bottle solves both convenience and compliance.
</ProTip>

## Waste Segregation

Siquijor takes waste segregation seriously. You'll notice color-coded bins throughout the island:

- **Green:** Biodegradable (food waste, organic materials)
- **Blue:** Recyclable (paper, cardboard, glass, metal)
- **Black/Gray:** Residual (non-recyclable, non-biodegradable)

Dispose of your waste in the correct bins. Your accommodation will also have segregation guidelines.

## Dress Code Guidelines

Siquijor is a traditional province with strong Catholic roots. While the beaches are relaxed, certain places require modest dress.

### At the Beach

- Swimwear is appropriate at beaches and resorts
- Cover up when walking to/from the beach through public areas
- Topless sunbathing is not acceptable

### In Churches

- Cover shoulders and knees
- Remove hats and caps
- Avoid overly tight or revealing clothing
- Light shawls or cover-ups are acceptable

### In Public Places

- Markets, banks, government offices expect modest attire
- Shorts are fine but avoid very short ones
- Tank tops may be frowned upon in some settings

<ProTip type="insider">
Carry a light sarong or cover-up when exploring. It works for beach-to-town transitions and can be quickly wrapped when entering churches.
</ProTip>

## Smoking Regulations

**Smoking is prohibited in public places**, especially at beaches.

- No smoking on any beach
- No smoking in restaurants (unless designated area)
- No smoking in public transportation
- Designated smoking areas exist in some establishments

Vaping falls under the same restrictions.

## Traffic Rules

If you're renting a motorcycle (most visitors do):

- **Valid license required** — International Driving Permit recommended for foreigners
- **Helmet is mandatory** — Rentals typically provide one
- **Follow local traffic laws** — Speed limits, one-way streets, etc.
- **Drive on the right side** of the road
- **Headlights on at all times** — Even during the day

<Warning severity="caution">
Philippine traffic rules apply. While enforcement may seem relaxed, accidents happen. Wear your helmet, drive defensively, and don't drink and drive.
</Warning>

## Alcohol and Nightlife

Siquijor has limited nightlife, but alcohol is available:

- No island-wide restrictions on alcohol sales
- Some barangays may have local ordinances
- Bars typically close earlier than in major cities (around 10-11 PM)
- Public intoxication is frowned upon

## Respect Local Culture

Siquijor has unique cultural elements, particularly around traditional healing and folk beliefs. Be respectful:

### When Visiting Healers

- Ask permission before taking photos
- Don't treat it as entertainment
- Be respectful even if skeptical
- Compensate fairly for their time

### At Religious Sites

- Churches are active places of worship, not just tourist attractions
- Keep voices low
- Don't interrupt services
- Ask before photographing people

### In Local Communities

- Greet locals with a smile and "Maayong buntag/hapon" (Good morning/afternoon)
- Ask permission before photographing people
- Don't litter—ever
- Respect private property

## Environmental Guidelines

Beyond the zero-waste policy:

### Marine Environment

- No collecting shells, coral, or marine life
- Use reef-safe sunscreen

### Natural Attractions

- Stay on marked trails

<ProTip type="tip">
Reef-safe sunscreen is increasingly available in Siquijor. If you can't find it, consider bringing your own from home. Regular sunscreen damages the coral reefs you came to see.
