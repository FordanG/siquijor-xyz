## Choosing Your Base

### For First-Time Visitors: San Juan

San Juan makes the most sense for first-timers. Easy access to restaurants, accommodations, and you can explore the entire island from there via motorcycle.

### For Culture & Waterfalls: Lazi

If your main interests are Cambugahay Falls, historic churches, and the Balete Tree, Lazi puts you closer to these attractions.

### For Solitude: Enrique Villanueva or Maria

These municipalities have limited tourist infrastructure but offer authentic, crowd-free experiences.

### For Practical Needs: Siquijor Town

If you need banks, hospitals, or government services, the capital town has everything.

## Getting Between Municipalities

The entire island is connected by one main coastal road (about 72km loop) plus interior roads to Maria and Mt. Bandilaan.

**By Motorcycle:**
- Complete loop: 2-3 hours without stops
- Any two adjacent municipalities: 15-25 minutes

**By Tricycle:**
- Available for hire for longer trips
- Negotiate fare before departing

**By Public Transport:**
- Limited jeepneys run between major towns
- Not tourist-friendly schedule

<ProTip type="save-money">
Rent a motorcycle (PHP 350-500/day) and you can explore all six municipalities at your own pace. It's the best way to see the island.
</ProTip>

## The Island Loop

Most visitors do a complete "roundabout" tour of the island, hitting attractions in multiple municipalities:

1. **San Juan** → Paliton Beach, Tubod Sanctuary
2. **Lazi** → Cambugahay Falls, Lazi Church, Balete Tree
3. **Maria** → Mt. Bandilaan viewpoint
4. **Enrique Villanueva** → Cantabon Cave, Pitogo Cliff
5. **Larena** → Quick stop or skip
6. **Siquijor Town** → Capilay Spring Park, return to base

This loop can be done in a full day, though two days allows for a more relaxed pace.

## Final Thoughts

Each of Siquijor's six municipalities offers something different. The beauty of this small island is that you can experience them all without extensive travel. Within 20-30 minutes, you can move from the tourist buzz of San Juan to the historical streets of Lazi to the quiet beaches of Enrique Villanueva.

Don't limit yourself to one area. Rent that motorcycle, hit the road, and discover why each municipality has its own magic.
