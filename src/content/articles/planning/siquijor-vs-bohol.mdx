# Siquijor vs Bohol: The Complete Comparison

Two islands, both in the Visayas, both stunning, both reachable from each other. But they offer fundamentally different experiences. This guide helps you choose—or convince you to visit both.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Siquijor | Bohol |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Size** | Small (343 km²) | Large (4,821 km²) |
| **Tourism Level** | Developing | Mature |
| **Main Activities** | Waterfalls, diving, healing culture | Chocolate Hills, tarsiers, island hopping |

| **Best For** | Relaxation, independence | Organized activities, variety |
| **Time Needed** | 3-5 days | 5-7 days |

## The Islands at a Glance

### Siquijor

The smallest province in the Philippines. Known for mysticism and traditional healing. Most tourists overlook it, keeping crowds minimal. Development is modest—no malls, few chain businesses, limited nightlife.

**The feeling**: Quiet. Authentic. Somewhat isolated. Like the Philippines of decades past.

### Bohol

Much larger and more developed. Famous for the Chocolate Hills geological formation and the tiny tarsier primate. Strong tourism infrastructure with resorts, tour operators, and organized activities.

**The feeling**: Developed but still beautiful. More facilities, more fellow tourists. Organized and accessible.

## Detailed Comparisons

### Beaches

**Siquijor Beaches:**
- Paliton Beach: White sand, quiet, famous rope swing
- Salagdoong Beach: Cliff jumping, coves
- Solangon: Main tourist beach, still relatively quiet
- San Juan: Several beach options

**Bohol Beaches:**
- Alona Beach (Panglao): The most developed, restaurants, bars, diving
- Dumaluan Beach: Longer, resorts, less crowded than Alona
- Anda: Rising alternative, less developed

**Verdict**: Both excellent. Bohol has more beach variety and development. Siquijor has quieter, less crowded beaches. If you want beachside restaurants and nightlife, Bohol wins. If you want solitude, Siquijor wins.

### Diving

**Siquijor Diving:**
- Marine sanctuaries with healthy reefs
- Macro life focus (nudibranchs, frogfish)

- 3-5 dive shops

**Bohol Diving:**
- Balicasag Island: World-class site
- Pamilacan: Dolphins, whale sharks (seasonal)
- More dive operators (competition = lower prices)
- Better technical diving infrastructure
- Day trips to various sites

**Verdict**: Serious divers should do both. Bohol has more variety and famous sites. Siquijor offers uncrowded sites and excellent macro.

Bohol is the well-reviewed restaurant that delivers what you expect. Siquijor is the discovery that becomes a personal favorite.

If forced to choose: go to Siquijor while it's still quiet. Bohol will always be there, well-organized and waiting. Siquijor is changing—in a few years, this comparison may read differently.

Or simply: go to both.
