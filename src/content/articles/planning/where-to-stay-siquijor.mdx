Finding the right place to stay can make or break your Siquijor experience. The good news? There's something for every budget and travel style on this enchanting island. From beachfront luxury resorts to cozy guesthouses and social hostels, Siquijor offers hundreds of accommodation options spread across its six municipalities.

## Best Areas to Stay

### San Juan — The Tourist Hub

**Best for:** First-time visitors, social travelers, easy access to everything

San Juan is where most tourists base themselves, and for good reason. The area offers:
- Easy access to Paliton Beach and Tubod Marine Sanctuary
- Most restaurants and cafes concentrated here
- Night scene (modest by city standards, but the liveliest on the island)
- Close proximity to many attractions
- Best selection of accommodation options

Most accommodations are dotted along the main road, with many within walking distance of beaches. If you want convenience and don't mind some company, San Juan is your spot.

### Lazi — Cultural Heart

**Best for:** Cultural enthusiasts, waterfall lovers, those seeking quiet

Lazi offers a more local experience with:
- Proximity to Cambugahay Falls, Lagaan Falls, and Locong Falls
- Historic Lazi Church and Convent
- The Old Enchanted Balete Tree nearby
- Quieter, more authentic atmosphere
- Generally lower prices

If you're focused on waterfalls and culture, basing yourself in Lazi saves travel time and immerses you in local life.

### Maria Town — Authentic Living

**Best for:** Those seeking authentic Filipino-style living, off-the-beaten-path travelers

Maria offers a genuine local experience without tourist infrastructure. It's less convenient for getting around but provides an unfiltered look at island life.

### Larena Town — Budget Hub

**Best for:** Budget travelers, ferry convenience

As a major ferry terminal and commercial center, Larena offers:
- Easy arrival and departure
- Budget-friendly options
- Commercial conveniences
- Less scenic than other areas

Practical for short stays or late arrivals, but most travelers prefer moving to San Juan or Lazi.

### Siquijor Town — Family-Friendly

**Best for:** Families, peaceful beach time

The capital town offers:
- Beautiful surrounding beaches
- Calm, family-friendly atmosphere
- Less crowded than San Juan
- Central location for exploring

<ProTip type="insider">
Since you'll likely rent a scooter, your accommodation location matters less than you think. As long as you're somewhere along the main coastal road, you can reach any attraction within 30-50 minutes.
</ProTip>

- **Holy Week:** Book at least 1 month ahead — the island fills completely
- **Low season (June-November):** Walk-ins often possible, but booking still recommended

### Where to Book
- **Booking.com** — Best selection, reliable reviews
- **Agoda** — Good for Asian properties
- **Airbnb** — Unique properties and longer stays
- **Direct booking** — Sometimes cheaper, but less protection

### What to Look For
- Location relative to attractions you want to visit
- Scooter rental availability
- Recent reviews mentioning current conditions
- Breakfast inclusion (saves morning hassle)
- Pool if it matters to you
- WiFi quality if you need to work

<ProTip>
Many accommodations can arrange scooter rentals for you or have rental contacts. Ask when booking—it saves time on arrival.
</ProTip>

## Power and Connectivity Notes

Siquijor has infrastructure challenges you should know about:

### Power Outages
Daily power cuts were common in the past, especially during Holy Week. Conditions have improved, but outages still occur. Consider:
- Accommodations with generators
- Packing a good power bank
- Being flexible with your schedule

### Internet
WiFi is available almost everywhere but quality varies wildly:
- Speeds are generally slow compared to city standards
- Video calls can be challenging
- Download content before arriving
- Cafes sometimes have better WiFi than hotels

## Special Considerations

### For Digital Nomads
If you need to work remotely:
- Look for accommodations specifically mentioning good WiFi
- Have a backup plan (mobile data, cafe hopping)
- Consider co-working friendly spaces
- Accept that this isn't Bali or Lisbon for digital nomad infrastructure

### For Solo Travelers
- Hostels offer the best social scene
- San Juan has the most traveler activity
- The island is very safe for solo travel
- Many accommodations cater to solo travelers

### For Couples
- Beachfront bungalows offer romance
- Sunset-facing rooms are worth the premium
- Private pool villas available at luxury properties
- Quiet areas like Lazi offer more intimacy

### For Families
- Look for properties with pools
- Siquijor Town tends to be more family-friendly
- Larger rooms and family suites available at resorts
- Safe, relaxed environment overall

<Warning severity="caution">
During Holy Week, accommodation prices can double and availability becomes extremely limited. Book early if your visit coincides with this period.
</Warning>

## Recommended Stays by Budget

### Budget (Under PHP 1,000)
1. **Fable Hostel** — Social, great location, backpacker favorite
2. **Payag n' Kapitan** — Authentic guesthouse experience
3. **Various homestays** — Found throughout the island

### Mid-Range (PHP 1,500-3,500)
1. **E&N Paradise Island Resort** — Near Pitogo Cliff, good facilities
2. **Villa Marmarine** — Japanese hospitality, beachfront
3. **Nakabalo Guesthouse** — Hills above San Juan, infinity pool with views

### Luxury (PHP 4,000+)
1. **Coco Grove Beach Resort** — Premier resort, best snorkeling beach
2. **Aloha Seaside Resort** — Convenient, well-equipped
3. **Various boutique options** — Check current listings

## Location Strategy

With a scooter, anywhere works. Without one, consider:

**If staying in San Juan:**
- Walking distance to beaches and restaurants
- Tricycles available for farther attractions
- Most convenient without wheels

**If staying in Lazi:**
- Walking distance to waterfalls (sort of)
- Will need transport for beaches and other areas
- More authentic but less convenient

**If staying elsewhere:**
- Beautiful but isolated options exist
- Scooter becomes essentially mandatory
- Peace and quiet guaranteed

## Final Advice

Siquijor accommodation is surprisingly good for a small island. Even budget options tend to be clean and friendly. The main differences between price points are usually:
- Air conditioning vs. fan
- Pool access
- Breakfast quality
- Beach proximity
- Overall polish and amenities

For most travelers, a mid-range option offers the best value: comfortable rooms, AC, and usually breakfast and pool access. Luxury splurges are worthwhile at places like Coco Grove if you want a premium experience.

Whatever you choose, remember: Siquijor is small and you'll spend most of your time out exploring. Your accommodation is a base for adventures, not the adventure itself.

Book something comfortable, rent a scooter, and get out there!
