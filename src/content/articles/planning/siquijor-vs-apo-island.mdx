This comparison helps you choose—or convince you that both belong on your itinerary.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Siquijor | Apo Island |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Size** | 343 km² | 0.72 km² |
| **Main Draw** | Varied activities | World-class diving |
| **Diving Focus** | Macro & sanctuaries | Turtles & pelagics |
| **Non-Diving Activities** | Many | Very limited |
| **Accommodation** | Wide range | Basic, limited |
| **Accessibility** | Direct ferries | Day trips or overnight |
| **Time Needed** | 3-7 days | 1-3 days |

## The Islands

### Siquijor

A full island destination with diving as one activity among waterfalls, caves, cultural experiences, and motorcycle touring. Development is modest but sufficient.

**Diving character**: Marine sanctuaries, macro life, walls, night diving. Good but not world-famous.

### Apo Island

A tiny volcanic island (72 hectares) managed as a marine protected area since the 1980s. The protection has created one of the Philippines' most successful marine conservation stories.

**Diving character**: Sea turtles (almost guaranteed), healthy reefs, schooling fish, mild currents. Famous specifically for turtle diving.

## The Combined Trip

### Option 1: Siquijor Base, Apo Day Trip

Base in Siquijor for 5-7 days. On one day, take the ferry to Dumaguete, join an Apo Island day trip, return to Siquijor in evening.

**Logistics**:
- Early ferry to Dumaguete
- Join arranged dive trip (pre-book)
- 2-3 dives at Apo
- Return to Dumaguete by late afternoon
- Evening ferry back to Siquijor

**Pros**: One base, both experiences
**Cons**: Long day, requires planning

### Option 2: Split Stay

3-4 days Siquijor + 2-3 days Dumaguete/Apo area.

**Logistics**:
- Stay in Siquijor first
- Ferry to Dumaguete
- Stay in Dauin or Dumaguete
- Day trips to Apo from Dauin (easier access)
- Fly out from Dumaguete

**Pros**: Easier logistics for Apo, more diving time
**Cons**: Two bases, more moving

### Option 3: Dumaguete Hub

Base in Dumaguete, day-trip to both Siquijor and Apo.

**Logistics**:
- Multiple days in Dumaguete
- Day trips to Siquijor (1-hour ferry each way)
- Day trips to Apo (30-45 min boat each way)

**Pros**: One base, both islands
**Cons**: Rush to see Siquijor in a day, miss overnight experience

<Warning>
Day-tripping to Siquijor from Dumaguete is possible but frustrating. You'll spend hours on ferries and see only highlights. If Siquijor interests you, stay there.
</Warning>

## Conservation Context

### Apo Island's Story

In the 1970s, Apo Island's reefs were damaged from destructive fishing. Starting in 1982, a small marine sanctuary was established. Community buy-in grew, enforcement increased, and fish populations rebounded.

Today, Apo is a model for community-based marine conservation. The turtles came as the ecosystem recovered.

### Siquijor's Network

Siquijor followed Apo's example, establishing multiple marine sanctuaries around the island. They're younger and smaller than Apo's but growing healthier.

### Your Role

At both destinations:
- Respect sanctuary rules
- Don't touch marine life
- Control your buoyancy
- Support conservation through patronage

## Final Recommendation

**For divers**: Both islands deserve your time. Apo for the spectacle of turtles. Siquijor for variety and independence.

**For non-divers**: Siquijor without question. Apo is a diving destination with minimal alternatives.

**For mixed groups**: Siquijor as base, possible Apo day trip for divers.

**For turtle lovers**: Don't skip Apo. It's a unique experience.

**For macro photographers**: Siquijor's sanctuaries rival anywhere in the Visayas for small subject diversity.

The Visayas offer both. Take them.
