Three days in Siquijor is the sweet spot. It's enough time to hit all the major attractions without rushing, while still leaving room for spontaneous discoveries. Here's exactly how to spend your time on the island.

## Before You Arrive

**Getting There**: No flights serve Siquijor directly. Take a ferry from Dumaguete (40 minutes, ~800 PHP) or Bohol (90 minutes, ~1,600 PHP). Both cities have airports with frequent connections.

**What to Arrange**:
- Scooter rental (250 PHP/day) - book through your accommodation
- Cash - ATMs exist but aren't always reliable
- Accommodation in San Juan (the main tourist hub)

<ProTip>
Arrive on the Dumaguete ferry to Siquijor Port (not Larena). It's closer to San Juan and most attractions.
</ProTip>

## Day 1: San Juan & Waterfalls

### Morning: Cambugahay Falls (6:30 AM - 10:00 AM)

Start your Siquijor adventure with the island's most famous waterfall. Leave your accommodation by 6:30 AM to arrive at opening (around 7 AM).

**Why early?** By 10 AM, tour groups arrive and you'll wait in line for the rope swing. In the early morning, you might have the turquoise pools entirely to yourself.

**Costs**:
- Entrance: 100 PHP
- Rope swing (unlimited): 50 PHP
- Parking: 20-30 PHP

**What to expect**: Three cascading tiers with stunning turquoise water. The rope swing at the first tier is the highlight—swing out over the pool and drop into crystal-clear water.

### Late Morning: Pitogo Cliff (10:30 AM - 11:30 AM)

On your way back from Cambugahay, stop at Pitogo Cliff. It's a quick detour that often surprises visitors.

**What makes it special**: Limestone cliffs overlooking calm, Mediterranean-blue water. The clarity is remarkable—you can see straight to the bottom.

**Costs**: 30 PHP entrance

Spend 30-40 minutes swimming and jumping off the platform, or just snap photos and continue on.

### Afternoon: Tubod Marine Sanctuary (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

After lunch and a break at your accommodation, head to Tubod Marine Sanctuary for snorkeling. It's right in San Juan, next to Coco Grove Beach Resort.

**Why it's underrated**: No boat or tour needed. Walk straight into the water and you're surrounded by coral, colorful fish, and often sea turtles.

**Costs**: 100 PHP entrance, gear rental available

### Evening: Sunset at Paliton Beach (5:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

End Day 1 at Paliton Beach for sunset. It's a few minutes from San Juan and offers the island's best sunset views.

**Pro tip**: Walk past the first beach area near the parking lot. Continue through the trees to find the larger, prettier stretch of sand with palm trees.

**Dinner**: Try Roch Cuisine for waterfront street food, or splurge at Dolce Amore for authentic Italian pizza (arrive by 5 PM for no wait).

## Day 2: Island Loop & Adventure

### Morning: Salagdoong Beach & Cliff Jumping (7:00 AM - 11:00 AM)

Today you'll drive the eastern coast to Salagdoong Beach, home to the island's best cliff jumping.

**The drive**: About 50 minutes from San Juan. The coastal road is scenic—consider stopping at Kagusuan Beach along the way.

**Cliff platforms**:
- 5 meters: Beginner-friendly
- 10 meters: For confident jumpers only

**Costs**: 50 PHP entrance + 20 PHP parking

<Warning>
Only jump at high tide when water is deepest. Check conditions before climbing the platforms. Never jump head-first.
</Warning>

### Midday: Lazi Church & Lunch (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM)

On your way back, stop at Lazi Church—the island's oldest and largest church, completed in 1884. The adjacent convent museum costs about 20 PHP.

Grab lunch in Lazi before continuing.

### Afternoon: Century-Old Balete Tree (2:00 PM - 2:30 PM)

**Honest take**: This 400-year-old enchanted tree with fish spa is on every Siquijor itinerary, but it's the island's biggest tourist trap. You'll spend 5 minutes looking at a tree and dipping your feet in water with nibbling fish.

Stop if you're passing by. Don't make it a destination.

**Costs**: 10-20 PHP entrance

### Late Afternoon: Lugnason Falls / Zodiac Falls (3:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

Also called Zodiac Falls, this is a less crowded alternative to Cambugahay. Local guides offer tours to additional waterfalls in the area (tip: around 500 PHP).

**Costs**: Free (10 PHP parking)

### Evening: Nakabalo Pool Sunset

If you want a splurge day, spend the afternoon and sunset at Nakabalo Guesthouse. Their infinity pool overlooks the ocean.

**Costs**: 1,000 PHP per person (600 PHP credit toward food/drinks)

---

## Day 3: Flexible Exploration

### Option A: Day Trip to Apo Island

If you're a diver or serious snorkeler, book a day trip to Apo Island. It's about an hour by boat and offers some of the best diving in the Visayas, including guaranteed sea turtle encounters.

**Costs**: 1,500-3,000 PHP depending on operator and activities

### Option B: Revisit Favorites

Spend the morning at whichever spot you loved most. Cambugahay is worth a second visit if you didn't get empty pools the first time.

### Option C: Hidden Gems

- **Lagaan Falls**: Less crowded waterfall in the interior
- **Cangbangag Falls**: Remote but stunning
- **Quisol Mountain View**: Panoramic viewpoint over the island

### Final Sunset

Wherever you spend the day, end at Paliton Beach again for sunset. Some moments are worth repeating.

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor rewards spontaneity. This itinerary gives you structure, but some of the best moments come from random stops—a viewpoint you spotted from the road, a beach with no name, a conversation with a local at a sari-sari store.

Rent the scooter. Wake up early. Stay for sunset. The island reveals itself to those who slow down.
