# Day Trips from Siquijor: Beyond the Island

Siquijor has plenty to fill a week without leaving. But sometimes you want variety—a city fix, different scenery, or practical errands that the island can't provide. Day trips offer that flexibility while keeping Siquijor as your peaceful home base.

This guide covers your options: the easy (Dumaguete), the popular (Apo Island), and the ambitious (Bohol).

## Quick Reference: Day Trip Options

| Destination | Ferry Time | Round Trip Cost | Best For |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Apo Island** | 1 hour (boat) | PHP 2,500-3,500 (tour) | Sea turtles, snorkeling |
| **Dumaguete** | 40-60 min | PHP 700-900 | City break, shopping, errands |
| **Bohol** | 2-3 hours | PHP 2,200-2,800 | NOT recommended as day trip |
| **Twin Lakes** | 3+ hours total | PHP 1,500-2,500 | Nature, hiking, kayaking |

**Note:** For Apo Island, we have a [complete separate guide](/articles/adventure/apo-island-day-trip). This article focuses on other destinations.

## Dumaguete Day Trip

### Why Visit Dumaguete

<LocationCard
  name="Dumaguete City"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.3068, lng: 123.3054 }}
  description="Vibrant university city - the 'City of Gentle People'"
  hours="Ferry departures 6 AM onwards"
  fee="PHP 350-450 one way"
  rating={4.2}
/>

Dumaguete is the perfect counterpoint to Siquijor's quiet. It's a university town with excellent food, functioning ATMs, well-stocked pharmacies, and the urban energy you might miss after days of island tranquility.

**Good Reasons for a Dumaguete Day Trip:**

- Stock up on supplies unavailable in Siquijor
- Reliable ATMs (Siquijor's can run dry)
- Better pharmacy and medical supply access
- City food scene (excellent restaurants, cafes)
- Shopping for forgotten items
- Fast internet at cafes if you need to work
- Simply want a change of scenery

### Getting There

**Ferry Options:**

| Operator | Type | Duration | Fare |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| OceanJet | Fast ferry | 40-50 min | PHP 400-500 |
| Montenegro | Slow ferry | 1.5-2 hours | PHP 200-300 |

Ferries depart from Siquijor Town or Larena—check which port your chosen operator uses.

**Sample Schedule (verify current times):**
- Siquijor to Dumaguete: 6:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM
- Dumaguete to Siquijor: 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 5:00 PM

<Warning severity="info">
Ferry schedules change frequently. Always confirm current times at ports or through your accommodation before planning a day trip.
</Warning>

### What to Do in Dumaguete

#### Morning Activities

**Rizal Boulevard**

The waterfront promenade is Dumaguete's heart. Start your day with breakfast at a seaside restaurant, watching boats come and go. The boulevard comes alive with joggers, families, and vendors. It's an easy, pleasant introduction to the city.

**Silliman University**

<LocationCard
  name="Silliman University"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.3050, lng: 123.3058 }}
  description="Historic campus founded 1901 - the oldest American university in Asia"
  hours="Campus open during daylight"
  fee="Free to walk around"
  rating={4.0}
/>

The oldest American-founded university in Asia spreads across a beautiful campus. Walk the grounds, visit the Anthropology Museum (Philippine artifacts, tribal culture), and enjoy the academic atmosphere. Entry is free; the museum has a small fee.

**Freedom Park and Cathedral**

The central plaza anchors Dumaguete's old town. St. Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral sits nearby. Morning market atmosphere, local life, good people-watching.

#### Lunch Spots

Dumaguete's food scene outshines Siquijor's. Options for every budget:

- **Sans Rival Bistro** - Famous for silogs (Filipino breakfast dishes) and silvanas (local dessert)
- **Lab-as Seafood Restaurant** - Fresh catches, local preparation
- **Gabby's Bistro** - Mix of Filipino and international, generous portions
- **Hayahay Treehouse Bar** - Casual, good views
- **Mooon Cafe** - Reliable chain, air-conditioned comfort

#### Afternoon Activities

**Shopping and Errands**

- **Lee Super Plaza / Robinsons** - Grocery, supplies, everything you forgot
- **Public Market** - Fresh produce, local goods, better prices
- **Pharmacies** - Mercury Drug and others stock what Siquijor lacks
- **Phone shops** - SIM cards, accessories, repairs

<ProTip type="save-money">
Stock up on groceries and supplies in Dumaguete before returning to Siquijor. Prices are 20-30% lower for many items, and selection is much better.
</ProTip>

**Practical Errands:**
- ATM withdrawals (more reliable than Siquijor machines)
- Bank transactions
- Pharmacy runs for specific medications
- Electronics purchases or repairs

#### Evening (If Staying Late)

If you catch a late ferry, Dumaguete rewards lingerers:

- Sunset at Rizal Boulevard (best in the city)
- Street food vendors emerge after dark
- Better nightlife than anywhere on Siquijor
- Multiple restaurant options for dinner

**Warning:** Know your last ferry time. Missing it means an unplanned Dumaguete overnight.

### Dumaguete Day Trip Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Ferry (round trip) | PHP 700-900 |
| Tricycle in city | PHP 50-100 per ride |
| Breakfast | PHP 100-200 |
| Lunch | PHP 200-350 |
| Coffee/snacks | PHP 100-200 |
| Shopping | Variable |
| **Day Total (excluding shopping)** | **PHP 1,150-1,750** |

### Dumaguete Tips

- Take the early ferry for maximum time
- Don't miss the last ferry back (usually around 5 PM)
- Bring an empty bag for shopping hauls
- Tricycles are everywhere—negotiate or confirm price first
- The waterfront area is walkable; tricycles for farther points
- Bring an umbrella in any season

## Bohol: Day Trip vs. Extended Stay

### The Honest Truth About Bohol Day Trips

**Can you do it?** Technically, yes.

**Should you?** Probably not.

Here's the math:
- Ferry to Tagbilaran: 2-3 hours
- First ferry from Larena: approximately 6 AM
- Last return ferry: approximately 5 PM
- Time in Bohol: 6-7 hours maximum
- Chocolate Hills distance from port: 1.5 hours each way

You'll spend 5-6 hours on ferries for 6-7 hours on land. Of that land time, 3 hours disappears in transit to attractions. You're left with perhaps 3-4 rushed hours of actual sightseeing.

<Warning>
Bohol day trips from Siquijor are technically possible but not recommended. You'll spend most of your day traveling. Save Bohol for a proper 2-3 night visit.
</Warning>

### If You Insist on a Day Trip

For those determined to try:

1. Book a tour in advance from Tagbilaran port
2. Accept you'll see only highlights: Chocolate Hills + Tarsier Sanctuary + maybe Loboc River
3. Skip everything else
4. Return exhausted
5. Probably wish you'd planned differently

### Better Approach: Combining Siquijor and Bohol

If Bohol is on your Philippines itinerary, plan it as a separate leg rather than a day trip.

**Option 1: Siquijor First**
- 3-4 days in Siquijor
- Morning ferry to Bohol (via Dumaguete or direct if available)
- 2-3 days exploring Bohol properly
- Depart from Tagbilaran (Bohol has an airport)

**Option 2: Bohol First**
- Fly into Tagbilaran
- 2-3 days in Bohol
- Ferry to Siquijor (Larena port)
- 3-4 days in Siquijor
- Depart via Dumaguete

**Ferry Route:**
- Siquijor (Larena) to Bohol (Tagbilaran): 2-3 hours
- Not daily ferries—check schedules carefully
- Alternative: Siquijor to Dumaguete, then Dumaguete to Bohol (longer but more departure options)

See our [Siquijor vs Bohol comparison](/articles/planning/siquijor-vs-bohol) for detailed planning help.

### What You'd See in Bohol (With Proper Time)

#### Chocolate Hills

<LocationCard
  name="Chocolate Hills"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.8036, lng: 124.1689 }}
  description="1,200+ unique geological formations - Bohol's icon"
  hours="6:00 AM - 6:00 PM"
  fee="PHP 50"
  rating={4.7}
/>

Over 1,200 cone-shaped hills turn brown in dry season—hence the "chocolate" name. A viewing platform offers panoramic views. Best at sunrise or sunset, which a day trip from Siquijor cannot provide.

#### Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary

The world's smallest primates, with enormous eyes, live in protected forest. The sanctuary offers ethical viewing (unlike some roadside attractions). Plan 30-60 minutes. About 45 minutes from Tagbilaran port.

#### Loboc River Cruise

Floating lunch on a bamboo boat with live music. Scenic riverbanks, buffet food, tourist experience. About an hour from port.

#### What Day Trips Miss

- Alona Beach (Panglao Island) - beach scene, diving
- Balicasag Island - world-class snorkeling and diving
- Hinagdanan Cave - swimming in an underground pool
- Man-Made Forest - photogenic mahogany corridor
- Baclayon Church - historic Spanish-era church

## Other Day Trip Destinations

### Twin Lakes (Negros Oriental)

A more feasible nature adventure than Bohol:

<LocationCard
  name="Twin Lakes - Balinsasayao"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.3667, lng: 123.1833 }}
  description="Volcanic crater lakes surrounded by forest - excellent hiking"
  hours="6:00 AM - 5:00 PM"
  fee="PHP 50-100 entrance"
  rating={4.4}
/>

**Getting There:**
1. Ferry to Dumaguete (45-60 minutes)
2. Hire transport to Twin Lakes (1-1.5 hours by car)

**What to Do:**
- Kayaking on the pristine lakes
- Hiking around crater rims
- Bird watching in surrounding forest
- Nature photography

**Best For:** Nature lovers wanting adventure beyond beaches. Combine with Dumaguete errands for a full day.

**Budget:** PHP 1,500-2,500 including transport, entrance, kayak rental, and food.

### Cebu (Multi-Day Extension)

Not a day trip, but worth mentioning for longer itineraries:

From Dumaguete, you can reach Cebu by:
- Bus (5-6 hours via ferry crossing at Liloan)
- Flight (if available)

Cebu offers:
- Oslob whale sharks (controversial but popular)
- Kawasan Falls canyoneering
- Cebu City exploration
- Better shopping
- International flight connections

Plan 2-3 days minimum if adding Cebu to your trip.

## Practical Day Trip Information

### Ferry Tips

**Booking:**
- Walk-up tickets usually available for Dumaguete route

**Avoiding Seasickness:**

<ProTip>

</ProTip>

### Transportation at Destinations

**In Dumaguete:**
- Tricycles everywhere (PHP 10-50 per ride)
- City center is walkable
- Grab available for convenience

**In Bohol (if you go):**
- Pre-arranged tours strongly recommended

### When Day Trips Make Sense

**Good reasons to leave Siquijor for a day:**
- Need reliable ATM access
- Medical supplies or pharmacy needs
- Craving city food variety
- Weather is poor on Siquijor (try Dumaguete)
- You've done everything on the island and have extra days

**When to skip day trips:**
- Only 3-4 days total (enjoy Siquijor fully first)
- Rough sea conditions forecast
- You genuinely dislike boat travel
- Siquijor itself is calling you to slow down

## Planning Your Day Trips

### Sample Week with Day Trips

For a 7-day Siquijor-based itinerary:

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Day 1 | Arrive in Siquijor, settle in |
| Day 2 | Explore San Juan, waterfalls |
| Day 3 | Island loop: east coast attractions |
| Day 4 | **Apo Island day trip** (turtles!) |
| Day 5 | Beach day, relaxation |
| Day 6 | **Dumaguete day trip** (city, shopping) |
| Day 7 | Morning activity, depart |

This balances island exploration with two off-island experiences without feeling rushed.

### Day Trip Checklist

Before leaving Siquijor:
- [ ] Confirm ferry schedule (day before)
- [ ] Set early alarm
- [ ] Withdraw cash (ATMs unreliable)
- [ ] Pack light day bag
- [ ] Bring snacks and water
- [ ] Seasickness medication (if needed)
- [ ] Phone charged, offline maps downloaded
- [ ] Know exact last return ferry time
- [ ] Inform accommodation of your plans
- [ ] Waterproof bag for electronics/valuables

## Final Thoughts

Day trips from Siquijor add variety, but they're optional. The island itself rewards those who stay put.

That said, the Apo Island turtle experience is genuinely unmissable. And a Dumaguete day trip solves practical problems while offering a fun change of pace.

As for Bohol—save it for another trip. The Chocolate Hills deserve more than a rushed drive-by between ferry rides. Give them the visit they merit.

The best advice: don't over-plan. Siquijor's magic is in its slow pace. If a day trip sounds like effort, skip it. There's always another waterfall to find, another sunset to watch, another quiet beach to discover.

Sometimes the best day trip is no trip at all.
