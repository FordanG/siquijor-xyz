Getting to Siquijor isn't complicated, but it does require planning since there's no airport on the island. All visitors arrive by ferry, typically through Dumaguete as the main gateway. Here's everything you need to know about reaching this mystical island.

## Overview: Two Main Routes

Most travelers reach Siquijor via one of these routes:

1. **Via Dumaguete** (most common) — Fly to Dumaguete, then take a 45-60 minute ferry
2. **Via Cebu** — Ferry directly from Cebu City or Liloan to Larena Port

Dumaguete is the easier and more frequent option, while Cebu is better for travelers already in the Visayas region.

## From Manila

Major airlines operate daily flights from Manila (NAIA) to Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport (DGT):

- **Cebu Pacific** — Multiple daily flights
- **Philippine Airlines** — Daily flights
- **AirAsia** — Select days

Flight time is approximately 1 hour 15 minutes. Book in advance for the best rates, especially during peak season.

### Step 2: Get to Dumaguete Port

From Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport to Dumaguete Port:
- **Tricycle:** PHP 150-200 (15-20 minutes)
- **Grab/Taxi:** PHP 200-300 (faster, more comfortable)

### Step 3: Take the Ferry to Siquijor

From Dumaguete Port, you have two ferry options:
