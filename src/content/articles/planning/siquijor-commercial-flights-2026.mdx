For decades, reaching Siquijor Island meant a ferry ride from Dumaguete, Tagbilaran, or Cebu. The journey was part of the charm, but it also kept the island relatively isolated compared to more accessible Philippine destinations. That changed in late 2025 when the first commercial flights began landing at Siquijor Airport, cutting travel time from Manila to just over an hour and opening a new chapter in the island's tourism story.

This guide covers everything travelers need to know about flying to Siquijor in 2026, from practical booking details to what the new air service means for the island experience.

## A Brief History of Siquijor Airport

Siquijor Airport (airport code TDG) sits in the municipality of Siquijor town, along the southwestern coast of the island. The airport has existed for years, primarily serving light aircraft and occasional charter flights. Its single runway, originally built to accommodate smaller planes, underwent improvements to handle commercial turboprop aircraft.

The runway was extended and resurfaced as part of broader infrastructure upgrades led by the Department of Transportation. Terminal facilities were also improved to handle passenger check-in, baggage, and basic amenities. While still modest by Philippine airport standards, the upgraded facility can now process scheduled commercial flights.

## What Airlines Fly to Siquijor?

As of early 2026, commercial service to Siquijor is operated by smaller regional carriers using turboprop aircraft. The initial routes connect Siquijor primarily to Cebu, with plans for direct Manila service using connecting flights through Cebu or Dumaguete hubs.

The aircraft used on these routes are typically ATR 72 turboprops or similar, carrying between 50 and 78 passengers. These are the same reliable workhorses that serve other smaller Philippine airports across the Visayas and Mindanao.

Flight schedules have been expanding gradually. Initial service started with a few weekly flights, and frequency has increased as demand grows. However, schedules remain subject to change, especially during weather events common in the Visayas region.

## Flight Routes and Travel Times

The key advantage of flying to Siquijor is the dramatic reduction in travel time. Here is how the new air routes compare to traditional ferry options.

### Cebu to Siquijor

By air, the flight from Cebu takes approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Compare this to the ferry route, which requires traveling from Cebu to Dumaguete (around four to five hours by bus or fast craft) and then taking another ferry to Siquijor (roughly one to two hours). The total ferry journey from Cebu can take eight hours or more including transfers and waiting times.

### Manila to Siquijor

While direct Manila flights are not yet established at the time of writing, travelers can fly Manila to Cebu (roughly one hour and 20 minutes) and connect to Siquijor. The total travel time, including layover, comes to around three to four hours. The traditional route from Manila involves flying to Dumaguete and then taking a ferry, totaling around four to five hours in the best case.

### Dumaguete Connection

Dumaguete remains the primary gateway for ferry access to Siquijor. Flights from Manila and Cebu to Dumaguete are frequent and well-established. From Dumaguete port, ferries to Siquijor depart multiple times daily, with the crossing taking between one and two hours depending on the vessel type.

## Booking Tips and Practical Advice

### How to Book

Flights to Siquijor can be booked through the operating airline's website or through major online travel agencies. Because these are relatively new routes, availability can be limited, especially during peak travel periods. Booking at least two to three weeks in advance is recommended, particularly for travel during weekends, holidays, and the dry season months of February through May.

### Baggage Considerations

Turboprop aircraft have stricter weight limits than larger jets. Expect checked baggage allowances of around 10 to 15 kilograms for economy class, with carry-on limits of 7 kilograms. If you are bringing diving equipment, surfboards, or other bulky gear, check the airline's oversized baggage policy before booking.

### Weather and Cancellations

Smaller aircraft are more susceptible to weather-related delays and cancellations. The Visayas region can experience sudden weather changes, particularly during the habagat (southwest monsoon) season from June through October. Always have a backup plan, such as the ferry route from Dumaguete, in case your flight is canceled.

### Airport Transfers

Siquijor Airport is located near the town center of Siquijor municipality. Tricycles and motorcycles-for-hire are available outside the terminal for transfers to your accommodation. Some resorts also offer airport pickup if you arrange it in advance. The airport's central location means most destinations on the island are within 30 to 45 minutes by road.

## What This Means for Siquijor Tourism

The introduction of commercial flights represents the most significant change in Siquijor's accessibility in decades. Several implications are worth considering for travelers planning a visit.

### Shorter Trips Become Viable

Previously, the lengthy ferry journey meant Siquijor was best suited for trips of at least three to four days to justify the travel time. With flights, weekend trips from Cebu or even Manila become practical. This opens the island to a broader range of travelers, including those with limited vacation time.

### Potential for More Visitors

Greater accessibility naturally means more visitors. Siquijor has long been valued for its uncrowded, laid-back atmosphere, a quality that distinguishes it from more developed Philippine destinations like Boracay or Palawan. Local officials and tourism stakeholders face the challenge of balancing increased visitor numbers with environmental preservation and the island's distinctive character.

### Rising Accommodation Demand

As visitor numbers increase, demand for accommodation will grow. Currently, Siquijor offers a mix of budget hostels, mid-range guesthouses, boutique resorts, and a handful of upscale properties. Travelers visiting during peak season should book accommodation well in advance, as the island's lodging supply is still relatively limited compared to larger destinations.

### Infrastructure Development

Air service is part of a broader infrastructure push on the island. Road improvements, water system upgrades, and telecommunications expansion are ongoing. The island's cell signal and internet connectivity have improved markedly in recent years, making it increasingly viable for digital nomads and remote workers alongside traditional tourists.

## Should You Fly or Take the Ferry?

Both options have their merits, and the best choice depends on your priorities.

### Choose the Flight If

You value time efficiency and want to maximize your days on the island. Flights are ideal for short trips, business travel, or anyone who finds long ferry rides uncomfortable. Families with young children may also prefer the shorter journey.

### Choose the Ferry If

You enjoy the journey as part of the experience. The ferry ride from Dumaguete offers beautiful views of the Visayan Sea, and arriving by boat gives you a dramatic first impression of Siquijor's coastline. Ferries are also generally cheaper than flights, making them the better option for budget travelers. Additionally, ferry schedules are more frequent and less susceptible to cancellation than flights.

### The Hybrid Approach

Consider flying one direction and taking the ferry the other. Fly into Siquijor to arrive fresh and with maximum time on the island, then take the ferry back to Dumaguete for the scenic experience and easier access to onward travel connections.

## Looking Ahead

The launch of commercial flights to Siquijor is still in its early stages. Route expansion, increased frequency, and potentially new airline entrants are all possibilities as the market develops. There has been discussion of future direct services from Manila, which would further reduce travel friction.

For travelers who have always wanted to visit Siquijor but were deterred by the long ferry journey, 2026 is an excellent year to make the trip. The island retains much of its unspoiled character while becoming more accessible than ever.

At the same time, the ease of getting there makes it all the more important for visitors to travel responsibly. Siquijor's small size, limited water resources, and fragile marine ecosystems require thoughtful tourism practices. Respect local customs, minimize waste, support locally owned businesses, and leave the island as pristine as you found it.

The mystical island of fire now has a runway to welcome you. Whether you arrive by air or by sea, Siquijor's enchantment remains the same: a place where time slows, nature astonishes, and the modern world feels very far away.
