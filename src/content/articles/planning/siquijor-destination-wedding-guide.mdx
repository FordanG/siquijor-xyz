## Why Siquijor for Your Wedding

Siquijor is not the first island that comes to mind when couples imagine a Philippine destination wedding. That distinction typically goes to Boracay, Palawan, or Siargao. But for couples who value intimacy over spectacle, authenticity over luxury branding, and genuine natural beauty over manufactured backdrops, Siquijor offers something none of those islands can match.

The island's compact size means your wedding guests can experience the entire destination without exhausting transfers. Its uncrowded beaches provide ceremony settings where the only sounds competing with your vows are the waves and the wind through coconut palms. And the cost advantage is substantial: a wedding on Siquijor can cost 40 to 60 percent less than an equivalent celebration on Boracay.

With the recent launch of Sunlight Air's commercial flights from Cebu in December 2025, accessibility has improved dramatically. What once required a multi-hour ferry journey now takes about an hour by air, making Siquijor a realistic option for guests traveling from Manila or international destinations.

## Legal Requirements for Getting Married in Siquijor

### For Filipino Couples

Filipino citizens planning to marry in Siquijor need to complete several legal steps. Start the process at least six weeks before your intended wedding date.

You will need to apply for a marriage license at the Municipal Civil Registrar's office in the municipality where the ceremony will take place. Required documents include birth certificates (PSA-issued), a Certificate of No Marriage (CENOMAR) from the PSA, valid government-issued IDs, and community tax certificates.

Both parties must attend a pre-marriage counseling seminar, which is typically offered at the municipal hall. The marriage license is valid for 120 days from the date of issuance.

### For Foreign Nationals

If one or both partners are foreign nationals, additional requirements apply. You will need a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from your country's embassy or consulate in the Philippines. This document confirms you are legally free to marry under the laws of your home country.

Additional documents include a valid passport, a sworn affidavit of legal capacity (if your country does not issue the certificate mentioned above), and proof of termination of any previous marriage if applicable.

Some embassies require an appointment several weeks in advance, so plan accordingly. The Australian, British, and American embassies in Manila are the most commonly visited for this purpose by tourists marrying in the Philippines.

### Civil vs. Religious Ceremonies

Civil ceremonies are officiated by a mayor or authorized municipal officer. Siquijor's six municipalities each have officials who can perform civil weddings, and outdoor ceremonies at beaches or private venues are permitted.

Religious ceremonies require coordination with the local parish. Siquijor has several historic churches, with the San Isidro Labrador Church in Lazi being the most photographed. Church weddings require additional preparation including baptismal certificates, confirmation certificates, and a canonical interview.

## Best Wedding Venues on Siquijor

### Beach Venues

**Paliton Beach** stands as Siquijor's premier beach wedding location. The long stretch of white sand backed by coconut palms creates a naturally photogenic aisle. Late afternoon ceremonies here benefit from spectacular sunset light. The beach is in San Juan municipality, close to most resorts and accommodations.

**Salagdoong Beach** in Maria offers a more dramatic setting with its elevated coastline and turquoise waters. The cove-like geography creates an intimate atmosphere, though the location is more remote and requires additional logistics for catering and equipment.

**Kagusuan Beach** provides a secluded option for couples wanting complete privacy. This hidden beach near Lazi requires a short hike to access, making it ideal for small elopements or intimate ceremonies with fewer than 20 guests.

### Resort Venues

Several resorts on Siquijor accommodate weddings with varying levels of service. Coco Grove Beach Resort in San Juan is the island's largest resort and has hosted numerous weddings with full event coordination. Their beachfront garden area can accommodate up to 100 guests.

Glamping Siquijor offers a unique venue for couples wanting a less traditional celebration. The combination of natural landscaping and stylish tented accommodations creates an atmosphere that blends rustic and refined.

For smaller, more intimate affairs, boutique properties like Salamangka Beach & Dive Resort provide personalized service and private beach access. Their team can arrange everything from flowers to catering for groups of 30 or fewer.

### Church Venues

The **San Isidro Labrador Church and Convent in Lazi** is a UNESCO World Heritage Site candidate and the most historically significant church on the island. Built in 1884, its coral stone architecture and centuries-old convent create a backdrop of genuine heritage. Church weddings here carry a weight of tradition that modern venues simply cannot replicate.

**St. Francis de Assisi Church in Siquijor town** overlooks the port area and offers a more accessible location for guests arriving by ferry. The church's elevated position provides views of the Bohol Sea.

## Planning Your Wedding Timeline

### 12 Months Before

Begin researching venues and reach out to local coordinators. Very few professional wedding planners operate on Siquijor, so consider hiring a Dumaguete-based planner who services the island, or work directly with your chosen resort's events team.

Secure your venue and accommodation block for guests. Siquijor has limited high-end accommodation, and rooms fill quickly during peak season (December through May). Booking early ensures your guests have options within walking distance of the venue.

### 6 Months Before

Begin the legal paperwork. If either partner is a foreign national, start the embassy documentation process immediately. Order your CENOMAR and PSA documents. Schedule pre-marriage counseling.

Arrange catering. Siquijor's restaurant scene has grown considerably, and several establishments offer off-site catering. Local caterers can prepare Filipino feasts featuring lechon, fresh seafood, and island specialties at a fraction of mainland city prices.

Book your photographer. While Siquijor has talented local photographers, many couples bring a photographer from Dumaguete or Cebu. Ensure they are familiar with the ferry schedules and have contingency plans for weather delays.

### 3 Months Before

Confirm all vendor bookings and finalize your ceremony details. Arrange transportation for guests from the port or airport. Tricycles can be chartered in groups, or you can hire a van for larger parties.

Order flowers. Siquijor does not have dedicated florists, but local markets sell fresh tropical blooms. For elaborate arrangements, work with a Dumaguete florist who can transport flowers on the morning ferry.

### 1 Month Before

Distribute a detailed information packet to guests covering ferry schedules, accommodation details, island transportation tips, and a suggested packing list. Remind guests about the new tourism ecological fee implemented in February 2026, which requires payment upon departure from the island.

Conduct a venue walk-through if possible. Confirm setup times, backup plans for rain, and sound equipment if needed.

## Budget Breakdown

A Siquijor destination wedding offers remarkable value. Here is a realistic breakdown for a 50-guest celebration:

**Venue rental:** PHP 15,000 to 50,000 (USD 270 to 900). Beach venues are often free or charge nominal cleanup fees. Resorts charge for dedicated event spaces.

**Catering:** PHP 500 to 1,200 per head (USD 9 to 22). A full Filipino buffet with lechon, grilled seafood, local vegetables, and rice runs at the lower end. Premium menus with imported ingredients or multi-course plated service cost more.

**Photography and videography:** PHP 25,000 to 80,000 (USD 450 to 1,450). Local photographers charge less, while Cebu or Manila-based teams at the upper range include pre-wedding shoots and drone coverage.

**Flowers and decorations:** PHP 10,000 to 40,000 (USD 180 to 720). Tropical arrangements using local orchids, frangipani, and palm fronds keep costs down while looking stunning.

**Music and entertainment:** PHP 5,000 to 30,000 (USD 90 to 540). Local acoustic musicians are affordable and talented. A full band brought from Dumaguete costs more.

**Marriage license and legal fees:** PHP 2,000 to 5,000 (USD 36 to 90).

**Guest accommodations (subsidized):** Budget PHP 1,500 to 4,000 per room per night if you plan to cover some or all guest housing costs.

**Total estimated range:** PHP 150,000 to 500,000 (USD 2,700 to 9,000) for a 50-guest wedding. This is roughly one-third to one-half what an equivalent wedding would cost on Boracay.

## Weather Considerations

The dry season from December through May is the safest window for an outdoor wedding on Siquijor. February through April offers the most reliable sunshine with minimal rain interruption.

June through November brings the wet season, with September and October typically seeing the most rainfall. That said, rain in Siquijor is often brief and dramatic rather than all-day, and a wet season wedding can still work with proper contingency planning.

If you choose the dry season, book well in advance. February through April is also peak tourist season, and accommodation availability tightens considerably.

Wind patterns matter for beach ceremonies. The northeast monsoon (amihan) blows from November through March, bringing drier weather but occasionally strong winds on east-facing beaches. West-facing venues like Paliton Beach are more sheltered during this period.

## Catering and Food

Siquijor's food scene has matured significantly in recent years, and your wedding menu can highlight the island's culinary character.

**Traditional Filipino feast:** A lechon (whole roasted pig) is the centerpiece of most Filipino celebrations. A full lechon on Siquijor costs PHP 6,000 to 10,000 and feeds approximately 40 to 50 guests. Pair it with kinilaw (Filipino ceviche) made with freshly caught tuna, grilled squid, local vegetable dishes like pinakbet, and steamed rice.

**Seafood-forward menu:** Siquijor's fishermen bring in fresh catch daily. Grilled blue marlin, baked lapu-lapu (grouper), buttered shrimp, and sinigang na hipon (shrimp in sour broth) make for an impressive spread that showcases the island's marine bounty.

**Desserts:** Local options include bibingka (rice cake), biko (sticky rice with coconut), and fresh tropical fruits. Mango is exceptional in the Visayas region and makes a beautiful dessert course on its own.

For drinks, consider incorporating Siquijor's tuba (coconut wine) into your cocktail menu for an authentic local touch. Pair it with more conventional options for guests who prefer familiar choices.

## Guest Experience and Activities

One advantage of a Siquijor destination wedding is that the island itself serves as entertainment for your guests. Build a multi-day itinerary around your celebration:

**Pre-wedding day:** Organize a group island tour covering Cambugahay Falls, the Old Enchanted Balete Tree, and a sunset session at Paliton Beach. This gives guests who arrived early a chance to bond and experience the island together.

**Wedding morning:** Arrange a relaxed beach breakfast for the wedding party. Some resorts offer group spa services including traditional hilot massage, which makes for a calming pre-ceremony experience.

**Post-wedding day:** A group snorkeling trip to Tubod Marine Sanctuary or a day trip to Apo Island for sea turtle encounters gives guests a memorable finale to the celebration weekend.

## Practical Tips for a Smooth Celebration

**Power and sound:** Siquijor occasionally experiences brownouts. If your ceremony or reception relies on amplified sound or lighting, arrange a backup generator. Many resorts have their own generators, but confirm this in advance.

**Accessibility:** Some of Siquijor's most beautiful venues require walking on uneven terrain or sandy paths. Communicate this to guests so they can choose appropriate footwear. Elderly or mobility-impaired guests may need assistance at certain locations.

**Internet and communication:** WiFi on Siquijor has improved but remains inconsistent. If you plan to livestream your ceremony for guests who could not travel, test the connection beforehand or arrange a mobile data hotspot with Globe or Smart.

**Vendor payments:** Many Siquijor vendors prefer cash payments. ATMs exist in Siquijor town and Larena, but they occasionally run out of cash during peak periods. Bring sufficient cash or arrange bank transfers in advance.

**Waste management:** Siquijor has active environmental protection initiatives. Choose biodegradable confetti or flower petals instead of plastic decorations. Work with your venue to ensure proper waste disposal after the event.

## Working with Local Vendors

Siquijor's vendor ecosystem is smaller than what you would find in established wedding destinations, but the personal touch can be extraordinary. Local vendors often go above and beyond because every wedding on the island is an event the community takes pride in.

For flowers, visit the Siquijor public market early in the morning for the best selection of fresh blooms. Vendors can also source specific flowers with advance notice.

For music, ask your resort or local contacts about musicians. Several talented acoustic guitarists and singers on the island regularly perform at restaurants and events.

For hair and makeup, Dumaguete-based artists who service Siquijor weddings are your best option. They are familiar with the ferry logistics and can arrive the morning of or the day before.

## Final Thoughts

A Siquijor destination wedding is not about grandeur or luxury brand names. It is about standing on a quiet beach with the person you love, surrounded by the people who matter most, on an island that still feels like a discovery rather than a destination.

The logistics require more hands-on planning than a wedding at a full-service venue in a major city. But the reward is a celebration that feels genuinely yours, set against one of the most beautiful and unspoiled backdrops in the Philippines.

Start planning early, embrace the island's pace, and let Siquijor's natural beauty do the heavy lifting. The island has a way of making everything feel a little more magical, and your wedding day will be no exception.
