# Family Travel Guide to Siquijor

Siquijor offers families something increasingly rare: an unplugged adventure where the attractions are natural and the pace is slow. Children remember swimming in turquoise waterfall pools, not scrolling on devices. They remember the fish nibbling their toes at the Balete Tree, the turtle they saw snorkeling, the swing over the beach at sunset.

This guide covers everything you need to plan a memorable family trip to Siquijor.

## Is Siquijor Right for Your Family?

### Why Families Love Siquijor

Siquijor works for families because of its manageable scale and genuine safety. The entire island is just 343 square kilometers—you can drive around it in an afternoon. Nothing feels overwhelming, and getting lost is temporary.

The island has extremely low crime rates. Locals are genuinely friendly, and the small population means everyone knows everyone. Children can explore with a level of freedom rare in most tourist destinations.

Natural attractions appeal to all ages. Waterfalls with rope swings, fish spas where tiny fish nibble your feet, beaches with swings over turquoise water—these experiences captivate children in ways that screen time cannot.

### Considerations for Families

Medical facilities on Siquijor are basic. The provincial hospital handles routine issues, but serious medical emergencies require transfer to Dumaguete (2+ hours including ferry). Travel insurance with medical evacuation coverage is essential for families.

There's limited organized children's entertainment. No theme parks, no kids' clubs, no gaming arcades. This is a feature for some families and a drawback for others. Know your children.

The tropical sun is intense. Children burn quickly, and heat exhaustion is a real risk during midday activities. Plan around it.

### Best Ages for Siquijor

**Infants (0-2):** Possible but challenging. Limited supplies available on island, intense heat, and most attractions aren't infant-appropriate. Beach resorts with pools are your best option.

**Toddlers (2-4):** A beach-focused trip works best. Waterfalls and tours can be tiring for little legs. Choose accommodations with pools and easy beach access.

**Young children (5-8):** The sweet spot begins here. Children can participate in most activities with supervision—wading in waterfalls, snorkeling in shallow areas, enjoying the fish spa.

**Tweens (9-12):** Ideal age. Cliff jumping at Salagdoong, rope swings at Cambugahay, snorkeling with fish—they can do it all and will remember it forever.

**Teens (13+):** Excellent. Old enough for independent exploration by motorcycle (with experience), night swimming, and more challenging adventures like cave exploration.

## Kid-Friendly Activities

### Waterfalls

#### Cambugahay Falls

<LocationCard
  name="Cambugahay Falls"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1847, lng: 123.5508 }}
  description="Three-tiered waterfall with turquoise pools - the top family activity"
  hours="6:00 AM - 6:00 PM"
  fee="PHP 30 entrance + PHP 50 rope swing"
  rating={4.9}
/>

Cambugahay is the island's most famous waterfall and possibly the best family activity. The three tiers offer options for all ages:

- **For Kids 7+:** The rope swing is safe with supervision. Staff help children get on and off.
- **For Kids 4-6:** Wade in the shallow edges of the first tier. The bamboo raft ride is gentle and fun.
- **For Toddlers:** Sit on rocks, splash in the edges, watch older kids swing.

Arrive before 9 AM to avoid crowds. Bring water shoes—rocks can be slippery. The bamboo raft ride (PHP 50) is worth it for families; children love being poled across the turquoise water.

#### Lugnason Falls (Zodiac Falls)

A quieter alternative when Cambugahay feels too crowded. The falls are smaller but the experience is more intimate. Local guides are available and helpful with children. The hike in is short but may require carrying younger kids over some rocky sections.

<ProTip type="insider">
Bring a waterproof phone case or GoPro for capturing memories. Rental underwater cameras are rarely available on the island—bring your own from Dumaguete or home.
</ProTip>

### Beaches

#### Paliton Beach

Calm, shallow water makes Paliton ideal for children. The famous swing provides photo opportunities for all ages—even toddlers can sit on it with a parent. Limited facilities mean you should bring supplies: water, snacks, sun protection.

#### Salagdoong Beach

<LocationCard

  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1234, lng: 123.6123 }}
  description="Beach resort with facilities, cliff jumping, and protected coves"
  hours="8:00 AM - 5:00 PM"
  fee="PHP 50 entrance"
  rating={4.5}
/>

Salagdoong has resort facilities—changing rooms, food stalls, and lifeguards during peak hours. The protected coves offer calm swimming for children. The cliff jumping platforms are for teens and adults only (and require swimming confidence).

#### Tubod Beach Marine Sanctuary

Excellent for introducing children to snorkeling. The marine sanctuary has abundant fish in shallow water. Life jackets are available. Children 6+ who can swim will love it; younger kids can enjoy the beach while parents take turns snorkeling.

### Easy Adventures

#### Old Enchanted Balete Tree

  coordinates={{ lat: 9.2012, lng: 123.5234 }}
  description="400-year-old tree with fish spa at its base"
  hours="6:00 AM - 6:00 PM"
  fee="PHP 10 entrance"
  rating={4.3}
/>

The fish spa appeals to all ages. Tiny fish nibble dead skin from your feet—it tickles! Children find this hilarious. The experience takes 15-30 minutes. Combine it with the nearby souvenir shopping and the mystical atmosphere of the ancient tree.

#### Butterfly Sanctuary

Near Mount Bandilaan, this small greenhouse features colorful Philippine butterflies. Educational and visually appealing for children. Best visited mid-morning when butterflies are most active. Combine it with a scenic drive through the island's interior.

### Marine Experiences

For families with children 6+ who can swim, snorkeling at Tubod Marine Sanctuary is unforgettable. The protected reef teems with colorful fish. Life jackets available.

For almost-guaranteed sea turtle encounters, the Apo Island day trip suits families with children 8+. The boat ride is an adventure in itself, and swimming with turtles creates lifetime memories.

<Warning severity="danger">
Never leave children unsupervised at waterfalls or beaches. Rocks can be slippery, depths vary unexpectedly, and currents exist. Even strong swimmers need watching in natural water.
</Warning>

## Family Accommodation Options

### Resorts with Family Amenities

**Coco Grove Beach Resort** is the most family-friendly option on the island. Multiple pools (including a shallow area for kids), direct beach access, restaurant on-site, and an activities desk for family tours. Expect to pay PHP 4,000-8,000 per night for family rooms.

### Guesthouses with Family Rooms

Several guesthouses in San Juan offer family configurations at lower prices (PHP 1,500-3,000). Look for places with:
- Multiple beds or adjoining rooms
- Kitchen access (useful for picky eaters)
- Pool or easy beach access
- Quiet location for nap times

### Vacation Rentals

For longer stays or larger families, houses with multiple bedrooms offer the best value. Kitchen facilities let you prepare familiar foods for picky eaters, and more space means happier families.

<ProTip type="save-money">
Contact accommodations directly about family rates. Many offer discounts for children or can add extra beds without full additional room charges.
</ProTip>

## Safety Tips for Families

### Sun Protection

The tropical sun is no joke. Children burn faster than adults and may not recognize the warning signs.

- Reapply reef-safe sunscreen every 2 hours (more frequently after swimming)
- Rash guards for water activities protect better than sunscreen alone
- Wide-brimmed hats are essential
- Plan indoor or shaded activities during peak sun (10 AM - 2 PM)
- Watch for signs of heat exhaustion: excessive thirst, fatigue, headache

### Water Safety

- Supervise children at all times near water—no exceptions
- Bring or rent life jackets for non-swimmers
- Check current conditions before swimming (ask locals)
- Some beaches have sudden drop-offs; ask about depth before letting children wade
- Waterfall pools vary in depth; test before children jump in

### Health Preparation

- Bring all prescription medications (pharmacies have limited stock)
- Pack a basic first aid kit: bandages, antiseptic, pain relievers
- Oral rehydration salts for stomach issues (common with dietary changes)
- Insect repellent with DEET for evenings
- Know the hospital location in Siquijor Town

### Transportation

- Car seats are not available on the island—bring your own if your child needs one
- Motorcycle transport is not suitable for young children
- Tricycles are safer but slow; consider private vehicle hire for families
- For the ferry, sit in the center of the vessel to minimize motion

## What to Pack for Kids

### Sun and Beach Essentials
- Reef-safe sunscreen SPF 50+ (multiple bottles)
- Rash guards/swim shirts
- Water shoes (essential for rocky areas, sea urchin protection)
- Goggles or masks sized for children
- Beach toys (limited availability on island)
- Inflatable arm bands or small life jacket

### Health and Safety
- All prescription medications (bring extra)
- Children's pain reliever/fever reducer
- Bandages, antiseptic, tweezers
- Oral rehydration packets
- Insect repellent
- Motion sickness medication

### Comfort Items
- Favorite snacks (stock up in Dumaguete before the ferry)
- Entertainment for ferry rides (tablets loaded with content, books, games)
- Familiar comfort items for younger children
- Lightweight rain jacket

<ProTip type="insider">
Stock up on baby supplies (diapers, formula, specific foods) in Dumaguete before the ferry. Selection on Siquijor is limited and prices are higher.
</ProTip>

## Budget for Families

### Daily Family Budget (2 Adults, 2 Children)

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range | Comfort |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation | PHP 1,500 | PHP 3,000 | PHP 6,000 |
| Food | PHP 1,200 | PHP 2,000 | PHP 3,000 |
| Transport | PHP 500 | PHP 800 | PHP 1,500 |
| Activities | PHP 500 | PHP 800 | PHP 1,500 |
| **Daily Total** | **PHP 3,700** | **PHP 6,600** | **PHP 12,000** |

### Money-Saving Tips

- Choose accommodations with kitchen (cook breakfast, save on meals)
- Eat at local eateries for some meals (kids usually like rice and chicken)
- Many attractions are free or cheap: beaches, Balete Tree, scenic drives
- Share snorkel equipment rentals between family members
- Bring snacks and water to avoid tourist-price purchases at attractions

## Practical Family Tips

### Mealtimes

Most restaurants welcome families. Plain rice and chicken are always available for picky eaters. Fresh fruit from markets makes healthy snacks. High chairs are uncommon—plan accordingly for toddlers.

### Nap Times and Downtime

Don't overschedule. Build in rest time during hot afternoons (12-3 PM). Air-conditioned accommodation helps everyone recover from morning activities. Consider staying at places with pools—an afternoon swim entertains children without requiring travel.

### Entertainment

Tablet or device loaded with content for ferry rides and restaurant waits. Books and activity packs for downtime. Simple beach toys entertain for hours. Snorkel gear keeps older children occupied indefinitely.

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor won't give you organized kids' clubs or air-conditioned entertainment centers. What it offers is better: real adventure in a safe, manageable environment.

Yes, it requires more planning than an all-inclusive resort. Yes, you'll need to bring supplies and accept simpler accommodations. But the trade-off is genuine experiences that create lasting family memories.

Pack the sunscreen. Board the ferry. Let Siquijor work its magic on your family.
