# Digital Nomad Guide to Siquijor: Honest Assessment

Siquijor is not Bali. It's not Chiang Mai. It's not a digital nomad hub with coworking spaces, nomad meetups, and reliable fiber internet.

But for certain types of remote workers—those who prioritize peace over networking, nature over nightlife, and can tolerate internet imperfection—Siquijor offers something increasingly valuable: genuine disconnect from the hustle.

This guide gives you the honest reality of working remotely from this small island.

## The Reality Check

### What Siquijor Offers

- Extremely peaceful environment
- Low cost of living
- Beautiful nature at your doorstep
- Escape from digital nomad crowds
- Real disconnection opportunity

### What Siquijor Lacks

- Reliable, fast internet
- Coworking spaces
- Nomad community
- Stable power (occasional outages)
- Backup options when things fail

### Who Siquijor Suits

**Ideal for:**
- Writers and creative workers
- Asynchronous workers (not many video calls)
- Those seeking to reduce screen time
- Solo workers comfortable without community
- People who work in bursts, not continuously
- Those who value environment over convenience

**Not ideal for:**
- Workers with constant video call needs
- Team-reliant work styles
- Those needing reliable backup options
- Workers who thrive in nomad communities
- Deadline-intensive work without margin for outages

## Internet Reality

### The Honest Assessment

Siquijor's internet is workable but unreliable. On good days, you'll manage everything. On bad days, you'll struggle with basic browsing.

### Options

**Resort/Accommodation WiFi**:
- Quality varies widely
- 5-20 Mbps typical, but inconsistent
- May drop during peak usage
- Ask specifically before booking

**Mobile Data (4G/LTE)**:
- Globe and Smart networks present
- Most reliable option for many workers
- Coverage varies by location
- Speeds: 10-30 Mbps when working

**Fixed Internet** (for long-term):
- PLDT and Converge have limited presence
- Installation requires landlord cooperation
- Speeds up to 50 Mbps possible
- Wait times for installation can be long

### Practical Setup

**Recommended approach:**
1. Accommodation with decent WiFi as primary
2. Mobile hotspot (Globe or Smart) as backup
3. Second SIM on different network as emergency
4. Accept that some days will be difficult

<ProTip>
Test multiple locations before committing to a long stay. Internet quality varies street by street. What works at one resort may not work at another 500m away.
</ProTip>

### Video Calls

Possible but not guaranteed:
- Audio calls: Generally fine
- Video calls: Test first, have camera-off backup
- Group calls: Most challenging
- Time: Early morning often more stable

## Work Spaces

### No Coworking Spaces

Unlike Bali, Lisbon, or Chiang Mai, Siquijor has no dedicated coworking facilities. You'll work from:
- Your accommodation
- Resort common areas
- Café tables

### Working from Accommodation

  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1823, lng: 123.4989 }}
  municipality="San Juan"
  highlights={["Most options", "Variable quality", "Ask about WiFi specifically"]}
/>

**What to look for:**
- Dedicated work desk or table
- Reliable power (or generator backup)
- Strong WiFi signal in room
- Quiet during work hours
- Comfortable seating

**What to ask before booking:**
- "What's your average WiFi speed?"
- "Do you have power backup?"
- "Is the WiFi reliable for video calls?"
- "Can I work from common areas?"

### Cafés with WiFi

Limited options exist:
- Beach bar cafés (variable quality)
- Resort restaurants (for guests)
- No dedicated work-friendly cafés

Reality: You'll primarily work from your accommodation.

## Accommodation for Nomads

### Monthly Rates

**Budget** (₱15,000-25,000/month):
- Basic room with fan
- Shared or private bathroom
- Simple WiFi
- Minimum amenities

**Comfortable** (₱30,000-50,000/month):
- Private room with AC
- Decent WiFi
- Kitchen access possible
- Work-friendly space

**Premium** (₱60,000+/month):
- Resort bungalow
- Best available WiFi
- Full amenities
- Work desk included

### Long-Stay Considerations

- Ask about monthly discounts (typically 20-40%)
- Test WiFi before committing
- Confirm what's included (utilities, cleaning)
- Understand checkout flexibility

<Warning>
Don't book a month remotely based on photos. Spend 2-3 days testing a property before committing to a longer stay.
</Warning>

## Cost of Living

### Monthly Budget Breakdown

**Budget Nomad** (₱30,000-40,000/month):
- Accommodation: ₱15,000-20,000
- Food (mostly local): ₱10,000-12,000
- Transport: ₱3,000-5,000
- Data/Internet: ₱1,500-2,000
- Activities: ₱2,000-3,000

**Comfortable Nomad** (₱50,000-70,000/month):
- Accommodation: ₱30,000-40,000
- Food (mixed local/tourist): ₱12,000-15,000
- Transport: ₱5,000-8,000
- Data/Internet: ₱2,000-3,000

- Occasional splurges: ₱3,000-5,000

### Comparison

Siquijor is roughly:
- 50% cheaper than Cebu City
- 40% cheaper than Bali
- 60% cheaper than Chiang Mai (center)
- 30% cheaper than most Philippine tourist areas

## The Work Rhythm

### Adjusting Your Schedule

Siquijor's timezone (UTC+8) and lifestyle suggest:
- **Early mornings**: Often best internet, cooler
- **Midday**: Beach, lunch, rest
- **Late afternoon**: Second work block
- **Sunset**: Mandatory break
- **Evening**: Light work if needed

### Managing Energy

The tropical pace affects work:
- Heat reduces afternoon productivity
- Quiet can become too quiet
- Lack of stimulation challenges some
- Discipline required without external structure

### The Disconnection Benefit

For many nomads, Siquijor's limitations become features:
- Forced focus during work blocks
- Genuine offline time
- Reduced digital distraction
- Nature as default activity

## Practical Necessities

### Banking

- ATMs in Siquijor Town and Larena
- Can run out of money (especially weekends)
- No international banks
- Bring cash buffer from Dumaguete

### SIM Cards

Get both major networks:
- **Globe**: Best coverage in tourist areas
- **Smart**: Sometimes better in other spots
- Unlimited data promos: ₱999-1,500/month

### Power

- Outages happen (especially during storms)
- Bring power banks
- Confirm if accommodation has generator
- Save work frequently

### Health

- Basic pharmacy available
- Hospital limited
- Serious issues require Dumaguete
- Travel insurance essential

## The Social Reality

### Nomad Community

There isn't one. You'll meet occasional other travelers working remotely, but nothing organized.

### Local Connections

The island's friendliness means you can:
- Develop relationships with locals
- Become a "regular" at spots
- Join community activities

### For Extroverts

This may be challenging. Consider:
- Monthly trips to Dumaguete or Cebu
- Video calls with friends intentionally
- Regular activity-based socializing (diving, etc.)

## A Typical Work Day

**5:30 AM**: Wake with sunrise. Coffee on balcony.

**6:00-9:00 AM**: Primary work block. Internet usually stable. Air is cool. Focus is high.

**9:00 AM**: Breakfast at local eatery. ₱80 for tapsilog and coffee.

**10:00 AM-12:00 PM**: Secondary work block. Respond to morning emails from European clients.

**12:00 PM**: Beach lunch. Swim. Rest.

**2:00-4:00 PM**: Reading, rest, or light work. Too hot for intensive focus.

**4:30 PM**: Motorcycle to new beach. Explore something.

**5:30 PM**: Sunset. Non-negotiable break.

**7:00 PM**: Dinner. Reading or social time.

**9:00 PM**: Early bed. The island is quiet anyway.

**Weekly output**: Less than city life. Quality: Higher. Stress: Lower.

## Making the Decision

### Try Before Committing

- Visit for 1-2 weeks before planning months
- Test your specific work needs
- Identify accommodation options
- Understand the rhythm

### One Month First

If you like it:
- Book one month
- Treat it as test run
- Evaluate at end
- Extend if working

### Know Your Limits

Siquijor isn't for everyone. If you need:
- Consistent high-speed internet
- Regular coworking community
- Lots of restaurant/café variety
- Nightlife and social scene

Consider Dumaguete, Cebu, or elsewhere instead.

## The Bottom Line

Siquijor works for digital nomads who are:
- Independent workers
- Flexible about connectivity
- Seeking peace over networking
- Self-motivated without external structure
- Ready to adjust to island rhythm

It doesn't work for those needing:
- Reliable video conferencing
- Nomad community
- Coworking infrastructure
- Consistent backup options

For the right person, Siquijor offers something rare: a place where work happens around life, not life around work. Where the default activity is nature. Where disconnect is the norm.

That's either exactly what you need or exactly what you don't.
