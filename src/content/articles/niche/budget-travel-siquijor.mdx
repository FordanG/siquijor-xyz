## Final Thoughts

Siquijor rewards budget travelers who embrace local life. The best experiences—swimming at Cambugahay, watching sunset at Paliton, riding the coastal road—cost little or nothing.

The island hasn't been fully developed for mass tourism, which means authenticity comes cheap. Eat at carinderias, stay at guesthouses, rent a motorcycle, and you'll see the same Siquijor as those spending five times more—maybe more, since you'll be closer to local life.

Budget travel here isn't about sacrifice. It's about smart choices that often lead to richer experiences. The PHP 50 lunch at a carinderia might be the best meal of your trip. The PHP 400 dorm bed puts you in a room full of future friends. The hitched ride becomes a conversation with a local.

Siquijor on a budget isn't a compromise. It's a feature.
