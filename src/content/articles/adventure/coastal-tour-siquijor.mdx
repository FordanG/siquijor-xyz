The "roundabout" or coastal tour is Siquijor's signature activity—a complete loop of the island hitting all major attractions in one epic day. At just 72km around the circumference, Siquijor is perfectly sized for a day-long exploration that leaves you satisfied but not exhausted.

## Overview

**Distance:** ~72km coastal road (plus detours to attractions)
**Duration:** 6-8 hours with stops
**Difficulty:** Easy (paved roads, gentle terrain)
**Best Mode:** Motorcycle (most popular) or organized tour

The coastal tour typically includes:
- 2-3 waterfalls
- 1-2 beaches
- Historical sites
- Viewpoints
- The famous Balete Tree

---

## Route Options

### Counter-Clockwise (Recommended)

Starting from San Juan, head **left** toward Lazi.

**Why This Direction:**
- Hit Cambugahay Falls early before crowds
- Visit churches and cultural sites during cooler morning
- Save beaches for afternoon sun
- End with sunset possibilities on west coast

### Clockwise

Starting from San Juan, head **right** toward Siquijor Town.

**Why This Direction:**
- Morning beach time at Salagdoong
- Waterfalls in afternoon (more crowds but you're swimming anyway)
- Historical sites when you're perhaps more tired
- Less popular, so more contrarian
