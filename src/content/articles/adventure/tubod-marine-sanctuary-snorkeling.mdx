If you're looking for the best snorkeling in Siquijor—maybe even the best shore snorkeling in the Philippines—look no further than **Tubod Marine Sanctuary**. Hidden behind Coco Grove Beach Resort in San Juan, this protected reef area packs an incredible amount of marine life into a space roughly the size of five rugby fields, all accessible directly from the beach.

## Why Tubod Marine Sanctuary is Exceptional

What makes Tubod truly special is the accessibility. There's no boat required, no long swim to reach the reef. You simply walk into the water from the beach and within minutes, you're surrounded by an underwater paradise. The sanctuary's protected status has allowed marine life to flourish, creating an ecosystem that rivals many boat-access dive sites.

We've snorkeled all over Southeast Asia, and this spot tops the charts. Whether you're learning to snorkel or a free-diving pro, this place delivers an unforgettable experience.

## What You'll See

### Sea Turtles
The sanctuary is home to several sea turtles that regularly graze on the seagrass and coral. Sightings are common, especially in the morning hours when the water is calmest.

### Thousands of Tropical Fish
Expect to see:
- Schools of sergeant majors
- Colorful parrotfish
- Butterflyfish
- Damselfish
- Clownfish in their anemone homes
- Triggerfish
- And hundreds more species

### Vibrant Coral Reef
The coral here is healthy and diverse, with both hard and soft corals creating a colorful underwater landscape. You'll see brain corals, table corals, and delicate fan corals swaying in the current.

### Giant Clams
The sanctuary is also home to giant clams, which can grow to impressive sizes. Their colorful mantles are a photographer's dream.

<ProTip type="insider">
The best time for snorkeling is morning before 11 AM. The water is calmest, visibility is at its best, and marine life is most active. By afternoon, wind can pick up and reduce visibility.

## Getting There

Tubod Marine Sanctuary is located in San Juan, just next to Coco Grove Beach Resort—the big orange luxury hotel you've probably driven past at some point.

**How to Access:**
1. Look for the small parking area off the main road
2. Leave your scooter in the parking area
3. It's a short walk down a driveway to the beach
4. Pay the entrance fee at the small building
5. Rent gear or bring your own
6. Walk straight into the ocean!

**Travel Times:**
- From San Juan town: 10 minutes
- From Paliton Beach: 10 minutes
- From Larena Port: 40 minutes
- From Siquijor Port: 35 minutes

## Snorkeling Tips

### Entering the Water
Depending on the tide:
- **High tide:** You can swim directly to the reef area
- **Low tide:** You may need to walk past shallow waters first. Be careful of the rocky portion—aqua shoes are recommended to avoid hurting your feet.

### Finding the Best Spots
The sanctuary covers a large area, so take your time exploring different sections. The guide can help you find the barracuda schools and best coral formations. In just a few minutes of following their lead, you'll be swimming with jackfish, barracudas, and countless tropical species.

### Photography
The clear waters and abundant marine life make this an excellent spot for underwater photography. Even a basic waterproof camera will capture amazing shots. The variety of fish and coral provides endless subjects.

<Warning severity="caution">
The rocky portion near the entrance can be sharp. Aqua shoes are highly recommended to avoid cutting your feet. Take your time walking through this section, especially at low tide.
</Warning>

## What to Bring

**Essential:**
- Swimwear
- Reef-safe sunscreen (apply before entering!)
- Cash for entrance fee and gear rental
- Towel
- Waterproof camera or phone case

**Recommended:**
- Your own snorkel and mask (better fit, saves rental fees)
- Fins (makes swimming easier)
- Aqua shoes (for rocky areas)
- Rash guard (sun protection)
- Water bottle

**Available for Rent:**
- Snorkel and mask sets
- Fins
- Life jackets (if needed)

<ProTip>
Bring your own snorkel gear if you have it. The rental equipment works fine, but your own gear will fit better and be more comfortable. Plus, you'll save money if you plan multiple snorkeling sessions.
</ProTip>

## The Beach Experience

Even if you're not snorkeling, Tubod Beach is a beautiful spot to spend time. The white sand beach with its clear waters is perfect for:
- Swimming
- Relaxing with a book
- Watching sunset with a San Miguel beer
- Beach photography

The beach has a peaceful atmosphere and often sees fewer visitors than Paliton Beach, making it a good alternative for those seeking quiet.

## Best Times to Visit

### Morning (8-11 AM)
- Calmest waters
- Best visibility
- Most active marine life
- Fewer people
- Ideal for photography

### Early Afternoon
- Still good conditions
- Water may be warmer
- Slightly more people

### Late Afternoon/Sunset
- Beautiful for beach relaxation
- Not ideal for snorkeling (wind often picks up)
- Great for a post-snorkel beer at sunset

## Combining with Other Activities

Tubod Marine Sanctuary fits perfectly into a San Juan-focused day:

**Suggested Itinerary:**
1. **8:00 AM** — Tubod Marine Sanctuary snorkeling (1-2 hours)
2. **10:30 AM** — Lugnason Falls for swimming and rope swings
3. **1:00 PM** — Lunch in San Juan town
4. **3:00 PM** — Explore local shops or rest at your accommodation
5. **5:00 PM** — Paliton Beach for sunset

## Tips for a Great Experience

1. **Apply sunscreen before arriving** — Give it time to absorb so it doesn't wash off immediately

2. **Go slow** — The more time you spend floating quietly, the more you'll see. Fish become less wary when you're calm.

3. **Don't touch anything** — Coral is fragile and some marine life can sting. Look with your eyes, not your hands.

4. **Stay horizontal** — Keep your fins off the bottom to avoid damaging coral or stirring up sediment.

5. **Watch for currents** — Minimal currents and waves make Tubod generally safe, but always be aware of your position relative to the beach.

6. **Set aside at least one hour** — You could easily spend longer exploring this incredible reef.

<Warning severity="danger">
Never touch or stand on coral. It can take decades to grow and seconds to destroy. Beyond the environmental damage, some corals can cause painful cuts or stings.
</Warning>
