# Wildlife & Nature Spotting in Siquijor

Siquijor won't rival the Galapagos for wildlife diversity or Borneo for spectacular encounters. But for a small Philippine island, it offers surprisingly rewarding nature experiences for those who slow down and look.

The sea turtle that glides past you at Tubod. The kingfisher perched on a mangrove branch at dawn. The first firefly lighting up in a tree, then dozens more following. These moments come to those who watch quietly, arrive early, and embrace Siquijor's unhurried pace.

## The Butterfly Garden

  name="Siquijor Butterfly Sanctuary"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1800, lng: 123.5100 }}
  description="Small butterfly greenhouse with various Philippine species"
  hours="8:00 AM - 5:00 PM daily"
  fee="PHP 50-100"
  rating={3.5}
/>

### What to Expect

The butterfly sanctuary is a small enclosed greenhouse in the mountains near Mount Bandilaan. Inside, you'll find various butterfly species native to the Philippines fluttering between flowering plants.

The experience is modest—this isn't a world-class facility. Expect 15-30 minutes of viewing time. You'll see butterflies at various life stages: caterpillars on leaves, chrysalises hanging from branches, and adult butterflies feeding on flowers.

### Species You Might See

- **Common Rose** (Pachliopta aristolochiae) - Black with crimson spots
- **Great Mormon** (Papilio memnon) - Large, dark with variable patterns
- **Tailed Jay** (Graphium agamemnon) - Green and black, fast-flying
- Various swallowtails and smaller species

### Tips for Your Visit

Visit mid-morning when butterflies are most active. Wear bright colors—butterflies sometimes land on visitors. Move slowly and quietly. Photography without flash is welcome.

### Honest Assessment

The butterfly garden is a 15-30 minute experience. Some visitors find it underwhelming; others appreciate the quiet encounter with these delicate creatures. It's best combined with nearby attractions rather than made a destination on its own.

<ProTip>
The Butterfly Garden is best combined with Mount Bandilaan (nearby viewpoint). Do the garden after the mountain when butterflies are more active in the mid-morning warmth.
</ProTip>

## Bird Watching in Siquijor

### Overview

Siquijor isn't a major birding destination, but casual observers will find decent variety. The island's forests, mangroves, and coastal areas support resident and migratory species. Early mornings and late afternoons yield the best sightings.

### Species to Watch For

#### Kingfishers

The star attractions for many visitors. Three species are possible:

- **White-throated Kingfisher** - Common near water, brilliant blue and brown
- **Collared Kingfisher** - Coastal areas, turquoise and white
- **Philippine Dwarf Kingfisher** - Rare and exciting find, tiny and colorful

#### Sunbirds

Small, nectar-feeding birds often seen in gardens:

- **Olive-backed Sunbird** - Common in flowering plants, males have iridescent throat
- **Purple-throated Sunbird** - Forest edges, stunning purple gorget on males

#### Doves and Pigeons

- **Pink-necked Green Pigeon** - Colorful, forest canopy
- **Philippine Cuckoo-Dove** - Endemic, distinctive call
- **Zebra Dove** - Common, gentle cooing

#### Herons and Egrets

Found in coastal and wetland areas:

- **Little Egret** - White, active hunter in shallows
- **Cattle Egret** - Fields, often following livestock
- **Black-crowned Night Heron** - Dusk and wetlands

#### Other Notable Species

- **Philippine Bulbul** - Common, cheerful song
- **Yellow-vented Bulbul** - Gardens and forest edges
- **Asian Glossy Starling** - Iridescent flocks
- **Philippine Coucal** - Large, distinctive bubbling call

### Best Birding Locations

#### Mount Bandilaan Area

The forested slopes offer the highest diversity on the island. Forest birds, occasional raptors overhead, and the best chance for endemic species. Best timing: 6-8 AM before heat drives birds into cover.

#### Coastal Mangroves

Various locations around the island have mangrove stands. Look for kingfishers, herons, and wading birds. Near Larena and along less-developed coastlines. Early morning or late afternoon best.

#### Resort Gardens

Even without leaving your accommodation, you'll spot sunbirds, bulbuls, and doves. Morning coffee with bird watching requires no effort at all.

<ProTip type="insider">
The road up to Mount Bandilaan passes through excellent birding habitat. Stop occasionally on the drive up, especially at dawn, and listen. The Philippine Coucal's distinctive bubbling call echoes through the forest.
</ProTip>

### Bird Photography Tips

Bring a telephoto lens (200mm minimum, 400mm better). Patience is essential—find a good spot and wait. Early morning light is best. A tripod helps with longer lenses. Learn bird calls to anticipate appearances.

## Marine Life Encounters

### Snorkeling Wildlife

#### Tubod Marine Sanctuary

<LocationCard
  name="Tubod Marine Sanctuary"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1640, lng: 123.4920 }}
  description="Best snorkeling site with diverse marine life"
  hours="6:00 AM - 5:30 PM"
  fee="PHP 50 sanctuary fee"
  rating={4.7}
/>

Tubod offers Siquijor's best accessible snorkeling. The marine sanctuary protects a healthy reef teeming with life.

**What You'll See:**

- **Clownfish** in anemones (think Nemo)
- **Parrotfish** in rainbow colors, crunching coral
- **Surgeonfish and tangs** schooling along the reef
- **Butterflyfish** in pairs, yellow and white patterns
- **Damselfish** fiercely defending their territory
- **Wrasses** in seemingly impossible colors
- **Moray eels** peeking from crevices
- **Sea stars and urchins** on the reef floor

Occasional turtle sightings make any snorkel session special.

#### Other Snorkel Sites

- **Paliton Beach** - Reef offshore, varying conditions
- **Sandugan Marine Sanctuary** - Quieter alternative
- **Salagdoong Beach** - Protected coves, good for beginners

### Sea Turtle Encounters

**In Siquijor:** Sea turtles are occasionally spotted while snorkeling at Tubod and other sites. Sightings aren't guaranteed but happen regularly. Green sea turtles are most common; hawksbill turtles appear occasionally.

**Apo Island (Day Trip):**

<LocationCard
  name="Apo Island"
  coordinates={{ lat: 9.0783, lng: 123.2683 }}
  description="World-famous turtle sanctuary - nearly guaranteed sightings"
  hours="Day trips depart 7-8 AM"
  fee="PHP 2,500-3,500 day trip"
  rating={4.9}
/>

For near-guaranteed turtle encounters, Apo Island is the destination. Multiple turtles per snorkel session is normal. They're calm and easily photographed. The day trip is worth it for wildlife enthusiasts.

<Warning severity="danger">
Never touch, chase, or ride sea turtles. This is illegal under Philippine law and harmful to the animals. Maintain 2 meters distance and let turtles approach you naturally.
</Warning>

### Diving Wildlife

Certified divers access additional marine life:

- **Reef sharks** at deeper sites
- **Eagle rays** seasonally passing through
- **Cuttlefish** - masters of camouflage
- **Octopus** - especially on night dives
- **Nudibranchs** - colorful sea slugs, photographer favorites
- **Frogfish** - bizarre and well-camouflaged
- **Seahorses** - ask dive guides for known locations

### Night Dive Creatures

Night diving reveals a different ecosystem:

- Octopus actively hunting
- Crustaceans emerging from hiding
- Sleeping fish tucked into coral
- Phosphorescent plankton glowing with movement
- Nocturnal predators on the prowl

See our [night diving guide](/articles/adventure/night-diving-siquijor) for details.

## Fireflies and Nocturnal Wildlife

### Firefly Viewing

Fireflies add magic to Siquijor evenings. Their synchronized blinking in mangrove trees creates a living light show.

**Where to Find Them:**
- Mangrove areas (various locations around the island)
- Coastal forests
- Near freshwater sources
- Ask locals for current active areas—spots vary seasonally

**When:**
- After dark (7 PM onwards)
- Best on moonless nights (dark skies improve visibility)
- Peak during dry season
- Avoid viewing right after heavy rain

**How to See Them:**
- Ask accommodation staff or local guides
- Some resorts can arrange viewings
- Boat-based trips in mangroves offer the best experience
- Be patient—eyes need 10-15 minutes to fully adjust to darkness

<ProTip>
For firefly viewing, turn off all lights including phone screens. Your eyes need time to fully adjust to darkness. The wait is worth it when the trees start twinkling.
</ProTip>

### Other Nocturnal Wildlife

**Fruit Bats:** Commonly seen at dusk, flying between trees. Their distinctive silhouettes against the sunset sky make for atmospheric photos. Best viewed from resorts near forested areas.

**Geckos:** Tokay geckos announce themselves with loud calls at night. House geckos are everywhere, helping control insects. Both are harmless and entertaining.

**Owls:** More often heard than seen. Various species inhabit forested areas. Their calls add to the nighttime soundscape.

**Insects:** Tropical nights bring fascinating insect life. Stick insects, colorful moths, rhinoceros beetles. Those bothered by bugs should stay indoors; those fascinated will find plenty to observe.

## Nature Photography Tips

### Equipment Recommendations

**For Marine Life:**
- Waterproof camera or underwater housing
- GoPro works well for casual shooting
- Underwater filters (red/magenta) correct color at depth

**For Birds and Butterflies:**
- Telephoto lens (200-400mm)
- Fast shutter speeds (1/500 second minimum)
- Continuous autofocus mode
- Monopod or tripod for stability

**For Fireflies:**
- Tripod essential (long exposures required)
- Wide aperture lens (f/2.8 or faster ideal)
- Manual focus set to infinity
- 20-30 second exposures typical

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor's wildlife isn't performing for tourists—it's simply living. Your job is to notice.

The island rewards patience and early rising. The visitors who see the most are those who sit quietly, arrive before the crowds, and pay attention to the margins: the forest edge at dawn, the reef at slack tide, the mangroves after dark.

Bring binoculars. Bring an underwater camera. Bring time. And let the island show you what it has.
