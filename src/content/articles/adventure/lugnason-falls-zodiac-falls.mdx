While most visitors flock to Cambugahay Falls, those in the know head to **Lugnason Falls**—also known as **Zodiac Falls**. This hidden gem in San Juan offers everything Cambugahay does, minus the crowds, plus a secret: behind it lie 11 more waterfalls waiting to be explored.

## Why Lugnason Falls is Worth the Visit

Lugnason Falls features a stunning 10-meter drop cascading into a pool of brilliant blue-green water that locals affectionately compare to Gatorade. The color is almost unreal—a crisp, clean teal-green that you have to see to believe. Add in the island's highest rope swing, rock jumping spots, and the legendary 12-waterfall tour, and you have one of Siquijor's best adventure destinations.

The best part? This place doesn't get crowded. You can show up, have the falls largely to yourself, and actually enjoy the experience without waiting in line or dodging selfie sticks.

## The Main Attraction

### The Waterfall
Lugnason Falls drops approximately 10 meters into a swimming hole that spans about 10 meters across. The pool is deep enough for jumping and the water is refreshingly cold—perfect for cooling off after the trek down.

### The 9-Meter Rope Swing
Home to the highest rope swing on the island, Lugnason Falls is where thrill-seekers come to test their limits. The swing launches you out over the pool for an adrenaline-pumping freefall into the turquoise water below.

<Warning severity="caution">
Always check the water depth before jumping! The water level varies depending on the season. During our second visit, there was significantly less water in the falls, making the rope swing unsafe that day. Ask the local guides about current conditions.
</Warning>

### Rock Jumping
If the rope swing seems too intense, there are plenty of rock jumping spots at various heights. These are more manageable but still provide that satisfying splash into the crystal-clear water.

<ProTip type="insider">
The local kids can do some pretty cool tricks on the rope swing. Watch them first to get a sense of how it's done, and don't be afraid to ask for tips. They're usually happy to help!
</ProTip>

## The 12 Zodiac Waterfalls Tour

Here's where Lugnason Falls truly becomes special. Beyond the main falls lie 11 additional waterfalls, accessible only with a local guide. This isn't a well-known attraction—you have to specifically ask for it when you arrive.

### What's Included
- Access to all 12 waterfalls
- Climbing through the jungle
- Swimming in multiple pools
- Man-made aqueducts
- Cold springs perfect for swimming
- Epic cliff jumping spots
- Cave exploration

### The Experience
The tour takes 2-3 hours and involves real adventure—climbing over rocks, wading through streams, and scrambling up jungle trails. Each waterfall has its own character, from small cascades to larger drops with deep swimming holes.

The guides are local residents who know every inch of the valley. They'll help you navigate tricky spots, show you the best jumping points, and share stories about the falls and their zodiac names.

<ProTip>
The guides work on a donation basis. A tip of around PHP 300-500 for a group is appropriate and helps support the local community. Our guide Richard was awesome—knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely fun to explore with.
