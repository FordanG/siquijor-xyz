# The Complete Guide to Siquijor's 72km Island Loop

There's a reason the motorcycle is the preferred transport for Siquijor exploration. The island's 72-kilometer coastal road is arguably the most scenic ride in the Central Visayas—a ribbon of asphalt threading between turquoise sea and forested hills, connecting fishing villages, hidden beaches, and centuries-old churches.

No other Philippine island offers this combination: roads smooth enough to forget you're in a developing country, traffic light enough to actually enjoy the ride, and scenery varied enough that every kilometer brings something new.

This guide covers everything you need for the ultimate Siquijor road trip—whether you're doing the full loop in a day or spreading it across your entire stay.

## Why Siquijor is Perfect for Motorcycle Touring

### The Roads

Siquijor's circumferential road was paved to an unusually high standard, with smooth asphalt, proper drainage, and generally clear lane markings. The coastal route is almost entirely flat, with gentle curves that make riding pleasurable rather than white-knuckle.

Interior roads leading to attractions like Cambugahay Falls and Mt. Bandilaan are narrower and hillier but still well-maintained.

### The Traffic

Forget Manila gridlock or Cebu chaos. Siquijor traffic consists mainly of tricycles, other tourists on scooters, and the occasional delivery truck. Outside of Siquijor Town and Larena, you might go 10 minutes without seeing another vehicle.

### The Scale

At just 343 square kilometers, Siquijor is intimate enough to explore thoroughly in a few days. You can ride the entire coastal loop in two hours or spend a week discovering every side road and hidden beach.

## Renting Your Ride

### Where to Rent

Rental shops cluster around the Larena port (where ferries arrive) and in San Juan (the main tourist area). Your accommodation can usually arrange rental delivery if you're staying elsewhere.

**Larena**: Best for renting upon arrival before heading to your accommodation.
**San Juan**: More selection, competitive prices, convenient for beach areas.

### What's Available

**Scooters (110-125cc)**: Honda Click, Yamaha Mio, Suzuki Address
- Best for: Solo riders, coastal routes, beginners
- Rate: ₱350-400/day

**Semi-automatic (125-150cc)**: Honda XRM, Yamaha Sniper
- Best for: Two-up riding, mountain routes, more experienced riders
- Rate: ₱400-450/day

**Manual Bikes (150cc+)**: Honda TMX, Kawasaki Barako
- Best for: Adventure riders, serious hill climbing
- Rate: ₱450-500/day

<ProTip>
Inspect the bike before accepting: check brakes, lights, horn, and tire condition. Take photos of any existing damage. Confirm what's included—usually a helmet and basic third-party insurance.
</ProTip>

### The Rental Process

1. Show valid ID and driver's license
2. Leave a deposit (usually ₱2,000-5,000 or leave an ID)
3. Receive bike, helmet, and sometimes a simple map
4. Fill the tank (usually returned empty)

### Fuel

Gas stations are located in the main towns:
- **Siquijor Town**: Shell, Petron
- **Larena**: Caltex, Shell
- **Lazi**: Petron
- **Maria**: Small local station

The full island loop takes about 4-5 liters, costing around ₱250-300. Fill up when you can—you don't want to search for "gas boys" (locals selling fuel in bottles) in remote areas.

## The Coastal Loop: A Complete Itinerary

Here's the full loop broken into segments, counter-clockwise from San Juan. Adjust based on your starting point.

### Segment 1: San Juan to Lazi (16km, 25 minutes)

**Starting Point**: Coco Grove or Solangon Beach area

The first stretch passes some of Siquijor's best beaches and the famous Paliton Beach (worth a stop if you haven't been). The road hugs the coast, with sea views on your left and coconut groves on your right.

  municipality="San Juan"
  highlights={["White sand", "Calm waters", "Swing photo spot"]}
/>

As you approach Lazi, the road turns inland briefly past rice paddies before reaching the town proper. The Lazi Church and Convent complex is visible from the road—don't miss it.

**Key Stops:**
- Paliton Beach (5 minutes off main road)
- Lazi Church and Convent (UNESCO heritage site candidate)
- Lazi Public Market (for local snacks)

### Segment 2: Lazi to Maria (14km, 20 minutes)

Leaving Lazi, you'll pass the turnoff for Cambugahay Falls (3km inland—a must-do, but perhaps save for another day if you're doing the full loop).

The road to Maria is one of the most scenic stretches, with the coastline often visible through palm trees. The fishing village of Kagusuan has a small marine sanctuary worth a snorkel.

  coordinates={{ lat: 9.1534, lng: 123.6456 }}
  municipality="Maria"
  highlights={["Snorkeling", "Quiet beach", "Local atmosphere"]}
/>

Maria town itself is small but pleasant, with a nice church square and a few local eateries.

### Segment 3: Maria to Enrique Villanueva (10km, 15 minutes)

The southeastern corner of the island is the least visited, which is exactly why you should ride it. Fishing boats line the shores, children wave from yards, and the pace slows noticeably.

This stretch feels like the "real" Siquijor—less tourist infrastructure, more daily island life.

**Key Stops:**
- Maria Baluarte (old watchtower ruins)
- Salagdoong Beach turnoff (leads to cliff jumping area)

<Warning>
Salagdoong Beach has a ₱50 entrance fee and is about 2km off the main road on a rough concrete path. Worth it for the cliff jumping, but adds 30+ minutes to your journey.
</Warning>

### Segment 4: Enrique Villanueva to Siquijor Town (12km, 18 minutes)

As you round the southeastern corner, views of neighboring Bohol and Cebu may appear on clear days. The road passes through several fishing barangays before reaching Siquijor Town.

Siquijor Town is the capital and commercial center—not particularly picturesque, but useful for supplies, ATMs, and lunch options.

  highlights={["ATMs", "Restaurants", "Supplies"]}
/>

### Segment 5: Siquijor Town to Larena (7km, 10 minutes)

A short stretch connects the capital to the ferry port of Larena. This is the island's busiest road, with the most traffic you'll encounter (which isn't saying much).

Larena is functional rather than beautiful—a transit point for most visitors. But the old lighthouse is worth a quick photo stop.

### Segment 6: Larena to San Juan (13km, 20 minutes)

The final stretch is a beauty, with the road occasionally cutting through rock outcrops that were dynamited to create the route. Sandugan Beach is accessed from this stretch—a local secret with good snorkeling.

As you approach San Juan, tourist infrastructure reappears: beach resorts, dive shops, restaurants. You've completed the loop.

## Interior Routes: Going Deeper

The coastal loop is just the beginning. Siquijor's interior offers different scenery and fewer tourists.

### Mt. Bandilaan National Park

The road to Siquijor's highest point (628m) winds through lush forest with occasional sea views. The summit has a small park, a telecommunications tower, and on clear days, views of five islands.

**Route**: From Cantabon (near Siquijor Town), take the signed road inland. About 8km, 20-25 minutes of climbing.

**Tip**: Your scooter will struggle on the hills. Keep momentum and don't be afraid to downshift. Early morning offers cooler temperatures for the climb.

### Cambugahay Falls Access

The road from Lazi to Cambugahay Falls is paved but hilly. After parking (₱20-30), it's a short walk down to the falls.

**Pro Move**: Visit the falls first thing in the morning before the tour groups arrive, then continue your loop.

### Butterfly Sanctuary Route

Several attractions inland near San Juan—the butterfly sanctuary, Forest Camp resort, and Balete Tree—can be connected in a 10km loop through the island's interior.

## Riding Tips for Siquijor

### General Safety

- Always wear your helmet—it's the law and enforced
- Drive on the right (Philippines follows right-hand traffic)
- Use your horn lightly before blind curves
- Watch for dogs, chickens, and children near villages
- Slow down near schools and churches

### Road Conditions

The coastal road is excellent, but watch for:
- Sand on curves near beaches
- Puddles after rain (may hide potholes)
- Slow tricycles on hills
- The occasional cow or goat wandering into traffic

### Weather

Rain can arrive quickly in the tropics. A light rain jacket in your bag is wise. If caught in a downpour, find shelter and wait—tropical rain rarely lasts more than 30 minutes.

<ProTip>
The west coast (San Juan area) is slightly drier than the east coast (Maria/Lazi) due to weather patterns. But honestly, the difference is minimal—the island is too small for dramatic climate variation.
</ProTip>

### What If Something Goes Wrong?

**Flat tire**: Vulcanizing shops (tire repair) exist in every barangay. Locals will point you to the nearest one. Cost: ₱50-100.

**Breakdown**: Your rental shop should provide a contact number. Most will rescue you and provide a replacement bike.

**Accident**: If minor, exchange information and call your rental shop. If serious, local barangay officials will help coordinate with authorities.

## Timing Your Ride

### Full Day Loop
- Start: 7:00-8:00 AM
- Return: 3:00-5:00 PM
- Includes: Multiple beach stops, lunch, short hikes

### Half Day Option
If time is limited, do the western loop (San Juan → Lazi → back) or eastern loop (San Juan → Larena → Siquijor Town → back). Each is about 30-35km.

### Multi-Day Exploration
Spread the island across your entire stay:
- Day 1: San Juan area and Paliton Beach
- Day 2: South coast to Salagdoong and Maria
- Day 3: East coast, Siquijor Town, and interior
- Day 4: Cambugahay Falls and mountain route

## Beyond the Main Loop

### Sunrise Ride
Leave before dawn and head to Paliton Beach or the eastern coast for sunrise. The roads are empty, the air is cool, and you'll have prime spots to yourself.

### Night Riding
Not recommended for tourists. Roads are poorly lit, dogs become more aggressive, and rental insurance may not cover nighttime accidents. Plan to return before dark.

### Secret Spots
Ask locals about their favorite swimming holes, viewpoints, and hidden beaches. Siquijor reveals its best secrets to those who take time to explore slowly and talk to residents.

## The Real Joy of Riding Siquijor

Guidebooks can list the stops, but they can't capture what makes riding Siquijor special: the feeling of salt air on your skin as you round a coastal curve, the wave from an old woman tending her garden, the spontaneous stop when you see a path disappearing into coconut palms.

The motorcycle isn't just transport here—it's a key to the island. Every sideroad is an invitation. Every shaded turnout could be a new favorite spot.

You'll return your bike with dust on your shoes, sun on your face, and a deeper understanding of why this small island captures travelers so completely.

The loop awaits. Twist the throttle.
