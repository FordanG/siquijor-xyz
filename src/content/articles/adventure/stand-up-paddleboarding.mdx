# Stand-Up Paddleboarding in Siquijor: Your Complete Guide

There's something magical about gliding across glassy water at sunrise, your paddle dipping silently as the first light paints the sky. Siquijor's protected coves and crystal-clear seas make it ideal for stand-up paddleboarding—whether you're a first-timer finding your balance or an experienced paddler exploring hidden coastlines.

This small island offers what larger destinations often lack: uncrowded waters, pristine marine environments, and the kind of calm conditions that make SUP accessible to everyone.

## Why Siquijor is Perfect for Paddleboarding

### Protected Waters

Unlike exposed coastlines where wind and waves challenge paddlers, Siquijor's geography creates natural shelters. The island sits in the relatively protected Bohol Sea, and its numerous coves break up wave action.

### Clear Visibility

Paddling over Siquijor's waters is like floating above an aquarium. The clarity allows you to watch sea turtles, schools of fish, and coral gardens pass beneath your board.

### Minimal Boat Traffic

No jet skis. Few speedboats. The occasional fishing banca putters by. Siquijor's waters belong to paddlers, swimmers, and the marine life that thrives in the absence of motorized chaos.

### Warm Year-Round

Water temperatures hover around 27-29°C throughout the year. No wetsuit needed, no cold shock upon falling—just comfortable tropical warmth.

## The Best SUP Spots in Siquijor

### San Juan Beach Area

The main tourist zone offers the most convenient paddling, with multiple rental options and calm, protected water.

**Best for**: Exploration, snorkeling stops, avoiding crowds

**Facilities**: Minimal—bring what you need

### South Coast

Less developed and more adventurous, the southern coast rewards those willing to transport their own board.

## Renting Equipment

### Where to Rent

**Resort Rentals**

Most mid-range and upscale resorts offer paddleboard rentals to guests and sometimes non-guests:

- **Coco Grove Beach Resort** - High-quality boards, guest priority
- **Islander's Paradise** - Budget-friendly rates, older equipment
- **Infinity Heights Resort** - Ocean views, premium boards

**Independent Rentals**

A few shops and individuals in San Juan rent boards:
- Ask at dive shops—many have SUP sidelines
- Beach boys may offer informal rentals
- Quality varies; inspect equipment before paying

### Typical Rates

| Duration | Price Range |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 hour | ₱300-400 |
| 2 hours | ₱500-600 |
| Half day (4 hours) | ₱800-1,000 |
| Full day | ₱1,200-1,500 |

<ProTip>
Negotiate for multi-day rentals if you're staying in Siquijor for a week or more. Some places will do 5-day rentals for the price of 3-4 days. Returning business is valued here.
</ProTip>

### What's Included

Standard rentals include:
- Paddleboard (typically 10'-11' all-around boards)
- Adjustable paddle
- Leash (ankle strap connecting you to board)

Sometimes included:
- Basic instruction
- Life vest
- Dry bag

Usually NOT included:
- Transport to/from paddling location
- Snorkeling gear
- Phone waterproofing

## Techniques for Siquijor Conditions

### Getting Started

If you've never paddled before, Siquijor's calm water makes learning forgiving:

1. **Start on knees**: Paddle on your knees first to find balance
2. **Stand up slowly**: One foot at a time, feet parallel, shoulder-width apart
3. **Eyes on horizon**: Look forward, not at your feet
4. **Paddle properly**: Blade fully submerged, pull toward yourself
5. **Fall backward**: If losing balance, fall back and away from the board

### Handling Light Chop

When afternoon breezes create small waves:
- Lower your stance slightly (bend knees more)
- Keep paddle in water more continuously
- Angle the board to take waves at 45 degrees
- Paddle with more power for stability

### Dealing with Current

Siquijor generally has minimal current, but near reef channels:
- Paddle into the current first while fresh
- Save the current-assisted direction for return
- Stay aware of your position relative to shore

<Warning>
If you find yourself being pulled offshore, don't exhaust yourself fighting. Signal for help, lay on your board to rest, and paddle parallel to shore to escape the current.
</Warning>

## Sunset SUP Sessions

The golden hour transforms paddleboarding from exercise to experience. Siquijor's west coast faces ideal sunset angles, and several spots offer prime viewing.

### The Route

Start 45 minutes before sunset from Solangon Beach or Paliton. Paddle south along the coast, finding your spot as the sky begins to color.

The trick is positioning yourself with the sunset behind you, so the water ahead reflects the colors. Watching both the source and reflection creates a 360-degree light show.

### Photography Tips

If bringing a camera:
- Waterproof housing or dry bag essential
- Phone in waterproof pouch works well
- Consider a GoPro mounted on board or paddle
- Silhouette shots of other paddlers are classic
- Get low for dramatic angles

### Practical Notes

- Water feels cooler after sunset—warm up on shore
- Know your return route before dark
- Headlamp useful if staying late
- Buddy system more important after sunset

## Mangrove Exploration

Siquijor has small pockets of mangrove, and exploring them by SUP offers unique perspective.

### Why Paddle Mangroves

- Wildlife: Herons, kingfishers, monitor lizards
- Shade: Escape the midday sun
- Calm: Completely protected water
- Unique: Few tourists venture here

### Where to Find Them

The best mangrove paddling is near Maria and in small pockets around Larena. These aren't vast mangrove forests—they're intimate groves perfect for an hour's exploration.

<ProTip>
Bring a snorkel. The shallow water among mangrove roots hosts juvenile fish and small creatures rarely seen on the reef. Drop anchor (or have someone hold your board) and slip in for a look.
</ProTip>

## Combining SUP with Other Activities

### SUP + Snorkeling

Several spots allow you to paddle out to snorkeling areas:
1. Paddle to reef edge (usually visible as color change)
2. Secure board with anchor or buddy
3. Snorkel the reef edge
4. Return refreshed

### SUP + Beach Hopping

Use your board as transport between San Juan beaches:
- Launch from Solangon
- Paddle west to Paliton (about 30 minutes)
- Beach time
- Return by paddle or arrange pickup

### SUP + Sunrise Yoga

Some resorts offer sunrise yoga on paddleboards—the ultimate balance challenge. Check with Coco Grove or ask around for current offerings.

## Practical Considerations

### What to Wear

**Essential:**
- Swimwear that won't ride up
- Rashguard or sun shirt (you're very exposed)
- Sunglasses with strap
- Reef-safe sunscreen

**Optional:**
- Water shoes for rocky entries
- Hat with chin strap
- Waterproof watch

### What to Bring

**Must have:**
- Water (dehydration sneaks up on you)
- Sunscreen for reapplication
- Waterproof bag for valuables

**Nice to have:**
- Snacks
- Snorkel gear
- Underwater camera
- Dry clothes for after

### Timing Your Session

**Best conditions**: 6-9 AM (calmest, coolest)
**Good alternative**: 4-6 PM (calming seas, sunset option)
**Avoid**: 11 AM-3 PM (hot, often windy, harsh light)

### Weather Considerations

Siquijor's dry season (November-May) offers the best conditions, but paddling is possible year-round:

- **Dry season**: More consistent calm, less rain
- **Shoulder months**: Good conditions with fewer tourists
- **Wet season**: Morning windows often calm, afternoon storms possible

Check wind forecasts—even if the forecast says 10kph, afternoon thermal winds can kick up chop quickly.

## Fitness and Wellness Angle

Paddleboarding is deceptive exercise. An hour on the water works your:

- **Core**: Constantly engaged for balance
- **Arms and shoulders**: Paddle stroke
- **Back**: Posture and rotation
- **Legs**: Subtle adjustments for stability
- **Cardio**: At whatever intensity you choose

It's also genuinely meditative. The rhythm of paddling, the focus on balance, the disconnect from devices—it's moving mindfulness.

## Safety Essentials

### Before You Go

- Tell someone your plans and expected return
- Check weather and wind forecasts
- Assess your skill level honestly
- Confirm equipment is in good condition

### On the Water

- Stay within sight of shore
- Wear your leash
- Know how to self-rescue (get back on board)
- Stay hydrated
- Watch for changing conditions

### If Something Goes Wrong

- If tired or cramping, lie on board and rest
- If conditions worsen, paddle to nearest shore (not necessarily your starting point)
- If separated from board, don't panic—swim calmly
- In emergency, wave arms and yell—fishing boats usually nearby

## Beyond Basic Paddling

### SUP Touring

For experienced paddlers, longer coastal routes offer adventure:
- San Juan to Lazi (with support vehicle meeting you)
- Circumnavigation segments (attempt only with experience and support)
- Island hopping to Apo Island (for experts with proper conditions and escort boat)

### SUP Fishing

Traditional fishing from paddleboard is growing. Bring a simple handline and try for small reef fish. Local fishermen are happy to share tips.

### SUP Fitness Training

The calm water is perfect for SUP-based workouts:
- Sprint intervals
- Long-distance endurance
- SUP yoga sequences
- Core training exercises

## The Paddler's Perspective

From a paddleboard, Siquijor reveals itself differently. You notice the colors of reef through clear water, the frigate birds circling overhead, the fisherfolk checking their nets. You're not in a vehicle rushing past, not on a boat with engine noise—you're part of the seascape, moving at its pace.

Some of the island's best moments come on the water: the silence of early morning, the drama of sunset, the surprise of a turtle surfacing nearby. These aren't experiences you can schedule. They're gifts that come from simply being present, paddle in hand, board beneath your feet.

Siquijor is small enough to know intimately, and there's no better way to know a coast than paddling every curve of it.
