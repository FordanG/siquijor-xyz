### Don't

## Final Thoughts

Siquijor may not have the diving reputation of Moalboal or Malapascua, but its marine sanctuaries offer accessible, rewarding underwater experiences. The advantage is intimacy—you won't fight crowds at Tubod, and the reef has recovered beautifully under protection.

For serious divers, make the day trip to Apo Island. Swimming with sea turtles in crystal-clear water is a memory that lasts.

Whether you're dipping your mask in for the first time or logging another dive, Siquijor's underwater world rewards exploration. The same mystical energy that defines the island above water somehow permeates below—a quiet, colorful magic where time slows and the real world fades away.

Grab your mask. The reef is waiting.
