If you're seeking the ultimate adrenaline rush in Siquijor, look no further than **Salagdoong Beach**. This stunning stretch of coastline in the municipality of Maria is home to the island's most famous cliff jumping spots, where brave souls leap from platforms as high as 10 meters into crystal-clear turquoise waters.

## Why Salagdoong is a Must-Visit

Salagdoong Beach combines natural beauty with heart-pounding adventure. The limestone cliffs have been developed into safe jumping platforms while maintaining their raw, natural appeal. The water below is remarkably clear, allowing you to see straight to the bottom—both reassuring and terrifying when you're standing 10 meters above.

<ProTip type="insider">
Arrive before 9 AM to have the platforms almost entirely to yourself. The tour groups typically arrive around 10-11 AM, and by noon, you might be waiting 15-20 minutes between jumps.
</ProTip>

## The Three Jumping Platforms

### Platform 1: The Starter (5 meters / 16 feet)

Perfect for first-timers, this platform gives you the cliff-jumping experience without overwhelming fear. The height is enough to feel the rush of freefall but low enough that even hesitant jumpers usually take the leap.

**Who should try it:** Anyone who can swim confidently
**Fear factor:** 3/10

### Platform 2: The Challenge (8 meters / 26 feet)

This middle platform is where most people find their limit. The extra 3 meters makes a significant psychological difference—you're high enough to feel genuinely nervous, and the fall is long enough to make you think about it.

**Who should try it:** Those comfortable with heights and experienced with the lower platform
**Fear factor:** 6/10

### Platform 3: The Beast (10 meters / 33 feet)

Standing at the top of the 10-meter platform, looking down at the water below, many people reconsider their life choices. This is a serious jump that requires commitment. Once you leap, there's no turning back—you'll be in freefall for nearly 1.5 seconds.

**Who should try it:** Experienced jumpers only, must be 18+
**Fear factor:** 9/10

<Warning severity="danger">
Never jump head-first from any platform. Enter the water feet-first with your arms crossed over your chest or held tightly at your sides to prevent injury. Keep your body straight to break the surface cleanly.
</Warning>

## How to Jump Safely

1. **Start from the lowest platform** even if you're confident. Every cliff jumping spot is different, and you need to understand the depth and any currents.

2. **Check the water first.** Look for any debris, swimmers below, or unusual water movement.

3. **Jump away from the cliff.** Give yourself a good push outward to clear any rocks or ledges below.

4. **Point your toes** and keep your body straight. A belly flop from 10 meters is incredibly painful and can cause injury.

5. **Cross your arms over your chest** to protect yourself on entry.

6. **Exhale before hitting the water** to prevent water from rushing up your nose.

The road to Salagdoong passes through some of the most scenic parts of Siquijor. Leave early and make stops at Kagusuan Beach and the Butterfly Sanctuary along the way.

3. **Use burst mode** to capture the perfect moment
4. **Shoot from below** for dramatic underwater entry shots
5. **Use a polarizing filter** to cut through water glare
