        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Siquijor.xyz was created to help travelers discover the authentic magic of Siquijor Island.
          Beyond the myths and mystery, we showcase the real experiences that make this island special:
          from cliff jumping at Salagdoong to sunrise photography spots, traditional healing rituals to
          hidden waterfalls.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Siquijor?</h2>
        <p>
          Often called the "Island of Fire" due to the bioluminescence once visible from the sea,
          Siquijor has long been associated with mysticism and traditional healing. While these
          elements remain part of the island's identity, there's so much more to discover:
          pristine beaches, world-class diving, stunning landscapes, and some of the friendliest
          locals in the Philippines.
        </p>
