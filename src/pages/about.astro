        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          Siquijor is different. While places like Siargao, Bohol, and Cebu have become polished tourist destinations,
          Siquijor remains refreshingly raw. The island is less built up, less crowded, and way more
          low-key. That's exactly why travelers who discover it often call it their favorite island in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created Siquijor.xyz to help you experience the island the right way—with practical information,
          honest recommendations, and none of the hype that plagues most travel content.
        </p>

        <h2>The Real Siquijor</h2>
        <p>
          Known as "Isla del Fuego" (Island of Fire) for the mysterious glow once visible from passing ships,
          Siquijor has a reputation that precedes it. Many Filipinos avoid the island due to stories of
          witchcraft and dark magic. The reality? Most residents are ordinary Catholics, the traditional
          healers (mananambal) practice an ancient art that predates colonization, and the only magic
          you'll find is in the turquoise waters of Cambugahay Falls.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes Siquijor special isn't the mysticism—it's the experience of circling the entire island
          on a scooter in 3 hours, stopping wherever looks interesting. It's watching sunset at Paliton Beach
          with palm trees silhouetted against orange skies. It's the 100-peso entrance fees and 250-peso
          scooter rentals that make everything accessible.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Actually Cover</h2>
        <p>
          Every guide on this site is based on real experiences. We tell you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What's worth your time</strong> — Cambugahay Falls, Paliton Beach, cliff jumping at Salagdoong</li>
          <li><strong>What you can skip</strong> — The Butterfly Sanctuary (tourist trap vibes), the Balete Tree (done in 5 minutes)</li>
          <li><strong>Actual costs</strong> — Entrance fees, scooter rentals, what to pay for guides</li>
          <li><strong>When to go</strong> — Arrive at Cambugahay before 9 AM, avoid Holy Week unless you want chaos</li>
          <li><strong>How to respect local culture</strong> — Especially when visiting traditional healers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>
          Here's what most guides won't tell you: you need a scooter. At 250 pesos per day (about $4.50),
          it gives you complete freedom to explore. The roads are well-paved, traffic is nearly nonexistent,
          and you can spontaneously stop at any beach, waterfall, or viewpoint. Tricycles and habal-habal
          (motorcycle taxis) work too, but you'll spend more time waiting than exploring.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>
          Dry season (November to May) is ideal, with April to July being the hottest months.
          Avoid Holy Week in April—ferries are packed, accommodations sell out, and power cuts are common.
          The shoulder months offer the best balance of good weather and fewer crowds.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          We don't accept payment for recommendations. When we say Cambugahay Falls is a must-see and the
          Butterfly Sanctuary isn't worth it, that's our honest opinion. We believe sustainable tourism
          means directing visitors to experiences that benefit local communities while preserving what
          makes Siquijor special.
        </p>
