    question: 'How do I get to Siquijor from Manila?',
    answer: 'Fly from Manila to Dumaguete (1.5 hours via Cebu Pacific or Philippine Airlines), then take a ferry to Siquijor (45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the ferry). There are no direct flights to Siquijor as the island has no airport.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much is the ferry to Siquijor?',
    answer: 'Ferry prices range from ₱130-400 from Dumaguete depending on the ferry company. OceanJet fast ferry costs ₱300-400 (45-60 min), while Montenegro Lines and GL Shipping slow ferries cost ₱130-200 (1.5-2 hours).',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to book ferries in advance?',
    answer: 'No, you can usually buy tickets at the port on the day of travel. The only exception is during Holy Week (Easter) when ferries fill up quickly - book a few days ahead during that period.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which port should I arrive at in Siquijor?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I bring a motorcycle on the ferry?',
    answer: 'Yes, the slow ferries (Montenegro Lines, GL Shipping) accept motorcycles for an additional fee. OceanJet fast ferries do not allow vehicles. Most visitors rent motorcycles on the island instead.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What time is the last ferry to Siquijor?',
    answer: 'The last ferry from Dumaguete typically departs around 5-6 PM, but schedules vary. Morning ferries are more reliable. If arriving late, arrange accommodation pickup in advance as tricycle availability decreases after dark.',

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Siquijor is accessible only by sea. There's no airport on the island, so all visitors
          arrive by ferry. The main entry points are from Dumaguete (most common), Bohol, and
          occasionally Cebu.
        </p>

        <h2>From Dumaguete (Most Popular)</h2>
        <p>
          Dumaguete is the gateway city to Siquijor. It's well-connected by air and sea,
          making it the easiest jumping-off point.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting to Dumaguete</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>By Air:</strong> Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport (DGT) has flights from Manila and Cebu via Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines</li>
          <li><strong>By Sea from Cebu:</strong> OceanJet fast ferry (4 hours) or overnight slow ferry</li>
          <li><strong>By Bus:</strong> From Cebu City via bus to the south then ferry (long but scenic)</li>
        </ul>

        <ProTip>
          OceanJet is fastest but pricier. Montenegro and GL Shipping are budget-friendly and allow
          you to ride on deck with views. Buy tickets at the port - no advance booking usually needed
          except during Holy Week.
        </ProTip>

        <h2>From Bohol</h2>
        <p>
          Direct ferries connect Tagbilaran (Bohol) to Larena port in Siquijor. This is ideal if
          you're combining Bohol and Siquijor in one trip.
        </p>

        <h3>Ferries from Tagbilaran to Siquijor</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OceanJet:</strong> 2-3 departures daily, approximately 2 hours, ₱500-700</li>
          <li><strong>Lite Shipping:</strong> Slower RORO ferry, approximately 3-4 hours, budget option</li>
        </ul>

        <Warning>
          Ferry schedules from Bohol change frequently. Always verify current schedules before your trip.
          Rough seas during monsoon season (June-October) can cause cancellations.
        </Warning>

        <h2>From Cebu</h2>
        <p>
          There's no direct ferry from Cebu City to Siquijor. You have two options:
        </p>

        <h3>Option 1: Via Dumaguete (Recommended)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Take OceanJet from Cebu to Dumaguete (4 hours)</li>
          <li>Transfer to Siquijor ferry (1 hour)</li>
          <li>Total: approximately 5-6 hours with transfer time</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Option 2: Via Bohol</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Take ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran, Bohol (2 hours)</li>
          <li>Transfer to Siquijor ferry (2 hours)</li>
          <li>Total: approximately 5-6 hours with transfer time</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Arriving in Siquijor</h2>
        <p>
          Ferries arrive at either <strong>Siquijor Port</strong> (Siquijor Town, east coast) or
          <strong>Larena Port</strong> (north coast). Both are functional towns but not tourist
          destinations. Most visitors head to San Juan on the west coast.
        </p>

        <h3>From the Port to Your Accommodation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tricycle:</strong> ₱200-400 to San Juan (negotiate before boarding)</li>
          <li><strong>Hotel Pickup:</strong> Many accommodations offer free or paid pickup - arrange in advance</li>
          <li><strong>Motorcycle Rental:</strong> Some rental shops near ports, but availability varies</li>
        </ul>

        <ProTip>
          If arriving on a late ferry, arrange accommodation pickup in advance. Tricycle availability
          decreases after dark, and prices increase.
        </ProTip>

        <h2>Practical Tips</h2>

        <h3>Best Time to Travel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning ferries:</strong> Most reliable, calmer seas</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid night ferries:</strong> Limited options, harder logistics on arrival</li>
          <li><strong>Off-season:</strong> Fewer crowds, same schedules</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Bring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cash (withdraw in Dumaguete - Siquijor ATMs can run out)</li>
          <li>Motion sickness medication if prone</li>
          <li>Light jacket (AC ferries can be cold)</li>
          <li>Charged phone with accommodation details</li>
          <li>Water and snacks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ferry Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrive 30-45 minutes before departure</li>
          <li>Keep your ticket - it's checked on boarding</li>
          <li>Open-air seating on slow ferries offers best views</li>
          <li>Watch your belongings but theft is rare</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Leaving Siquijor</h2>
        <p>
          The same ferry lines operate in reverse. Book your return based on your onward travel:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flying out of Dumaguete:</strong> Early ferry, then taxi to airport</li>
          <li><strong>Heading to Bohol:</strong> Direct ferry from Larena</li>
          <li><strong>Going to Cebu:</strong> Via Dumaguete or Bohol</li>
        </ul>
